    "abstract": "In this paper we show that the helium-like hydrogen spectra obtained by Randell L. Mills  and ultra-dense hydrogen obtained by Holmlid  can be interpreted as experimental evidence of Binuclear Atoms. The hydrogen Binuclear Atom, a model proposed 25 years ago, is a metastable configuration in which the two nuclei are held together at a very short distance in an atom-like configuration. This should be a distinctive configuration of the hydrogen molecule where nuclei are characterized by a high kinetic energy, and nuclear motion is coupled with electronic motion. This is a completely different model from the usual Born-Oppenheimer picture of atoms and molecules we are used to, where nuclei oscillate about their equilibrium positions and electronic motion is decoupled from the nuclear one. The identification of helium-like hydrogen spectra and ultra-dense hydrogen as Binuclear Atoms has a strong impact on one of the main objections to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR): the overcoming of the Coulomb barrier thus identifying a sound mechanism for the occurrence of LENR.  This work is not  conclusive. The only goal of this work is to focus the attention of people interested in LENR mechanism on this subject, and encourage them to take this hypothesis more seriously.",

Charged particle emission was measured by the CR-32 plastic track detector. The results of experiments with different detectors are in good agreement with each other.

Using the threshold resonance reaction mechanism, we derive formulae for S-factor, which can be used in BECNF theory to obtain the nuclear reaction rate.

This aspect of loaded hydride is important in that the resistance-loading curve is often used as a diagnostic in experiments to estimate the loading ratio. Understanding transport provides other important insights into some features of the nuclear reaction mechanism. This research involves both ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. For the ionic part, the focus is on the charge state of hydrogen/deuteron, in both a static and a dynamic (hopping) situation. Experiments show that hydrogen hops as fractional-charged positive ion in Pd lattice [1,2] while previous band structure calculations [3-5] always gave a negatively charged H in the ground state. This discrepancy is addressed in the current research and some results are already published [6]. The collective motion of ions is studied in the phonon structure and electron-phonon coupling constant using a perturbation density functional theory. The electronic part focuses on the density of state and the Fermi surface, which when combined with the electron-phonon coupling constant, determine the temperature and the H/D loading dependant resistivity curves. Our numerical results [7] qualitatively match experimental trends. The possible connections between this transport theory/mechanism and the non-equilibrium conditions required for excess heat are discussed.",

At low loading it is impossible to fit solubility data over a wide range of temperature assuming only O-site occupation; however, with T-site occupation a good fit is obtained and an O-site to T-site excitation energy near 105 meV is found. Results from neutron diffraction studies at modest loading, and resistance and solubility measurements at high pressure and high loading, are used to infer O-site to T-site excitation energies and develop a smooth fit. The resulting statistical mechanics models have been optimized to provide systematic results at high loading for PdH and PdD, and also to fit the isotherms of the phase diagram of PdH. Estimates for the O-site energy as a function of loading and temperature have been developed in the latter case.",

An analysis of the data based on an empirical solubility model based on O-site occupation allows for an understanding of the data at low temperature, but probably is not a good starting place for understanding the solubility at high temperature. We have applied a recently developed empirical model for both O-site and T-site occupation to this data set, and find good agreement between data and a basic version of the model which assumes that the O-site and T-site partition functions are taken to be harmonic oscillator partition functions. Even better agreement is obtained when a more realistic O-site partition function is used. A range of optimum models with different assumptions about the T-site partition function is considered, and it is found to be possible to select one that matches the T-site occupation at zero loading inferred from neutron diffraction measurements of Pitt and Gray (Europhys. Let. 64 (2003) 344). The O-site to T-site excitation energy is assumed independent of temperature in these models, and we obtain specific model values of 105.3 meV for a-phase PdDX and 106.5 meV for a-phase PdHX.",

These cannot be explained by bound-electron screening which may give at most an energy of 20 eV for the DD reaction and of 0.3 keV for the Li+d reaction, but suggests the existence of an additional, and important, mechanism. Perhaps there is a fluidity of deuterons in metals that also reduces the Coulomb barrier between the fusing nulcei.",

Tritium production at a given potential ceased after a few days, but could be restarted by a small increase of the deuterium overpotential. Correspondingly, He4 was found in 9-10 pieces of the Pd electrode at 2-100 times background. Addition of fresh amounts of D2O quenched the T production which began again spontaneously after 1-2 days. If the T had come from contamination, 3He would have been found in the electrode: it was absent. Loss of charge by the nucleus lakes place when the fugacity of D in voids exceeds 10^17 atm (Lifshitz and Pitaevskii, 1963). Sporadicity of function arises from the state of the surface, which is difficult to reproduce. The surface state controls the mechanism of D- evolution: only some mechanisms give a fugacity high enough to cause fusion. Only one electrode out of four examined produced T and 4He. The surface of this electrode contained a Cu-mosaic structure, not seen on the inactive electrodes.",

The tubing and solution were heated to a steady state temperature of 249?C using an FR heater. Hydrogen at 1100 psig was applied to the inside of the tubing. After the application of hydrogen, a 32?C increase in temperature of the cell was measured which corresponds to 25 watts of heat.

We have determined the form of such an optimum dependence of the correlation coefficient on time, at which the formation of a maximally correlated states of particles and the attainment of the maximum variance of their coordinates under a parametric pumping of a harmonic oscillator are possible. The conditions allowing the choice of those possible laws of variations of the frequency of a harmonic oscillator, which cause the formation of a correlated state, are established.

    "abstract": "The potential benefits of LENR as a source of energy have been well understood since its announcement in 1989. The improved prospects of LENR in the past few years are indicated by the significant numbers and varied locations of researchers in several countries, a large body of accumulated evidence, major advances in explanation and theory development, and recent favourable occurrences, including a plethora of proposed energy-producing devices. The changing landscape creates policymaking opportunities for supporting LENR to realize its potential benefits, planning proactively to deal with anticipated adverse secondary impacts, and integrating the updates in a comprehensive policy program. The first policymaking opportunity, updates of current policies for LENR support, may best be accomplished in a framework of evidence-based policymaking. The level of evidence for the existence of LENR is at least a preponderance of evidence (greater than 50% probability). There may even be clear and convincing evidence (greater than 70%). Correspondingly, the policy response should be at least reinstatement and research comparable to other emerging energy technologies. Enhanced support, perhaps on a par with hot fusion, is indicated if there is clear and convincing evidence. The second policymaking opportunity related to LENR?s changing landscape is to address potential adverse secondary impacts with proactive planning. Broad deployment of LENR for energy supply may be expected to have major secondary impacts as a disruptive technology. Direct impacts will take place on all phases of the energy chain ? supply, transport, storage, and consumption. Indirect impacts will be felt most by the components of society that are closely tied to the energy cycle, such as sectors of the workforce and energy-based communities. Technology assessment is a mature and readily available methodology for identifying secondary impacts and developing mitigative measures. A third policymaking opportunity is to integrate LENR policy updates that are needed as demonstrated by its changing landscape. Policies for mitigating adverse secondary impacts, for example, can be formulated based on policies for LENR support and the resulting pace of its development and deployment. New and updated policies may also be integrated at the national and international level and between the public and private sectors. The public interest will be served by update and integration of LENR policies for its development and mitigating its impacts. However, many challenges must be overcome to achieve the update and integration objectives. The world desperately needs new sources of clean and inexpensive energy.

In a series of experiments the probability of D-D approach for random initial conditions was calculated, when initial energies of approaching deuterons were set in the range of energies 0.01-0.51 eV. For each experimental value of D-D approach the reaction rate was calculated on the shifted Coulomb potential with the shift energy, which equals to the energy of screening. The mean distance of D-D approach on all series equals 0.97 angstroms, that exceeds the mean distance in a molecule D-D. However, more than 14% of all experimental values show an approach of deuterons for a distance less than 0.1 angstroms. The general reaction rate for the given set of the initial conditions will make 10^1.91 DD^-1 s^-1. It is 4 orders of magnitude less, than the analogous rate calculated earlier for palladium deuteride. For optimization of calculations the most favorable initial conditions were selected. As a result the rate of the reaction calculated according to the above model should be additionally multiplied by a correction factor, which allows for the probability of the occurrence of these favorable conditions. In our case it equals 10^-16 - 10^-18; the rate of the nuclear fusion reaction of deuterons in titanium deuteride should be 3-4 orders lower, than the earlier calculated rate for palladium deuteride and equals 10^-14 - 10*-16 DD^-1 s^-1.",

Initially, an attempt was made to replicate the work at NRL in collaboration with MHI. When replication proved difficult, another set of experiments were conducted at MHI in three sets consisting of two control blanks and one positive foil (that should have transmuted Cesium to Praseodymium) per set. Foil samples were split for analysis at both NRL and MHI. Extensive analytical work was performed to characterize the foils and the blanks. When extracted at MHI, low nanogram amounts of Pr were found by ICP-MS on 3 of 3 foils that should have had Pr whereas the 6 controls were blank. Split solutions of these extracts were also tested independently at NRL and the presence of Pr was confirmed. The Pr found did not have the characteristic rare earth contamination expected if the Pr was from the environment and thus looked like it was produced in the experiment. Unfortunately, we could not find Pr at NRL (even at trace levels) on our split foil samples no matter what extraction method was employed. After considering and evaluating several unlikely scenarios for these disparate results, we visited MHI and participated in the extraction process on new foils. These extracts were blank when tested at both laboratories. Environmental samples were obtained at various locations where samples were handled. Pr was found in large amounts at one location used in sample preparation and this Pr had the signature of pure material rather than an inadvertent contaminate. No record of how it got there could be established. Other rare and characteristic impurities also were found in the extracts from MHI that were present in the laboratory environment. Thus, we concluded that the transmutation of Cs to Pr when deuterium permeated MHI?s multilayer structure could not be firmly established, as contamination during the foil production or during the foil analysis could not be ruled-out.

Correspondingly we focus on the D2/ 4He transition as a two-level system coupled to an oscillator, in order to make a connection with the lossy spin-boson model considered in previous work. Because of the strong Coulomb repulsion between the deuterons, the associated coupling matrix element is very small, and there is no possibility of converting the transition energy to oscillator quanta within a simple lossy spin-boson model. This motivates us to generalize to more complicated model that includes a set of (donor) two-level systems for the D2/ 4He transition, and a set of (receiver) two-level systems that are strongly coupled to the oscillator. We analyze the resulting model in the limit that the receiver system is very strongly coupled. Within this formulation, the associated dynamics can be interpreted in terms of a transition from D2 to 4He with direct conversion (and fractionation) of the large energy quantum to the oscillator, once the coupling with the receiver system is sufficiently strong.",

An introduction shows the importance of the deep orbits of hydrogen (H or D) for research in the LENR domain, and gives some general considerations on the Electron Deep Orbits (EDOs). In a first part we quickly recall the known criticism against the EDO and how we face it. In particular, a solution to fix all problems is to consider a modified Coulomb potential with finite value inside the nucleus. For this reason, we deeply analyzed the specific work of Maly and Va?vra on deep orbits as solutions of the Dirac equation, with such a modified Coulomb potential without singular point. Then, by using a more complete ansatz, we made numerous computations on the wavefunctions of these EDOs, allowing to confirm the approximate size of the mean radii ?r? of orbits and to find further properties. Moreover, we observed that the essential element for obtaining deep orbits solutions is special relativity. At a first glance, this fact results from an obvious algebraic property of the expression of energy levels obtained by the relativistic equations. Now, a comparative analysis of the relativistic and of the non-relativistic Schr?dinger equation allows us to affirm that Special Relativity leads to the existence of EDOs because of the non-linear form of the relativistic expression for the total energy, which implies a relativistic non-linear correction to the Coulomb potential.",

    "abstract": "Excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment presents numerous challenges for theorists, the biggest of which is to account for the absence of energetic nuclear particles in amounts commensurate with the energy produced. Our focus has been on the development of such a model, with recent progress reviewed. To account for excess heat production we contemplate a complicated model based on nuclear excitation transfer, subdivision and the down-conversion of keV nuclear quanta to a large number of phonons. The phonon-nuclear interaction that provides the foundation has been derived from a many-nucleon Dirac formalism, and we discuss recent efforts to confirm and improve upon the derivation. The quantification of the models under consideration require the evaluation of phonon-nuclear matrix elements, with recent progress discussed. The first step in the excess heat model involves the excitation transfer of a 24 MeV quantum associated with the D2/4He transition, which motivates a consideration of modeling and connections with experiments showing low-level energetic nuclear emissions. The analogous first step in the case of the 5.5 MeV quantum associated with the HD/3He transition is considered, where there is the possibility of low-level energetic nuclear emission, and where the issue of the availability of near-resonant energy levels can be studied. A nearby level in 137Cs is identified, which suggests a possible mechanism for the acceleration of the decay rate. We have recently revisited the issue of the null reaction, in which a D2/4He transition leads to the production of a compact D2 state from 4He, with the conclusion that this may be important in models for excess heat production and for low-level nuclear emission. Progress on subdivision is reviewed, including connections with experiments showing low-level nuclear emission, and candidates for laboratory tests. The possibility of a new 57Co/57Fe resonant excitation transfer experiment in a near single crystal sample is presented.

The absorption of deuterium by Ti is a reversible process and when titanium is heated in a deuterium atmosphere, the reaction will continue until the concentration of deuterium in the metal attains an equilibrium value. This equilibrium value depends on the specimen temperature and the pressure of the surrounding deuterium atmosphere. Any imposed temperature or pressure change causes rejection or absorption of deuterium until a new equilibrium state is achieved. If the surface of titanium is clean, the rate of absorption increases rapidly with temperature. At temperatures above 500?C, the equilibrium is achieved in a matter of a few seconds. However deuterium absorption is considerably reduced if the surface of Ti is contaminated with oxygen. Keeping in view these facts, a procedure was evolved for titanium target preparation and subsequent deuteration.

In each case, particular forms of coherence are used that implicitly provide a mechanism for understanding how LENR?s can proceed without the emission of high energy particles.? In addition, additional ideas, associated with Conventional Condensed Matter physics, are used to extend the earlier Ion Band State (IBS) model by C&C.? The general model clarifies the origin of coherent processes that initiate LENR?s, through the onset of ion conduction that can occur through ionic fluctuations in nanoscale crystals. In the case of PdDx , these fluctuations begin to occur as x -> 1 in sub-lattice structures with characteristic dimensions of 60 nm.? The resulting LENR?s are triggered by the polarization between injected d?s and electrons (immediately above the Fermi energy) that takes place in finite-size PdD crystals.? During the prolonged charging of PdDx , the applied, external electric field induces these fluctuations through a form of Zener tunneling that mimics the kind of tunneling, predicted by Zener, that is responsible for possible conduction (referred to as Zener-electric breakdown) in insulators.?

The CR-39 detectors used in this replication underwent exhaustive analysis by noted CR-39 experts from NASA and Russian Academy of Sciences. We also address alternative explanations offered by other researchers as to the source of the pitting in CR-39 detectors used in Pd/D co-deposition. These include deuteroxide/O2 attack, shockwaves resulting from D2/O2 recombination, and corona discharge. We also explored why the pits are primarily circular in shape and why the emission of Pd K shell X-rays is not observed.",

A high-precision calorimeter (Calvet) was used to detect heat flow when the heater was shut down and the palladium tube was cooling down slowly. At certain temperatures an abnormal deuterium flux appeared. This deuterium flux reached a peak when the temperature of the palladium was decreasing. This abnormal deuterium flux differs from the monotonic feature of a normal diffusive flux and is accompanied by a heat flow.",

The catalysts were characterized with CO-chemisorption, transmission electron micrographs, and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry. The precious metal dispersion and the catalytic activity are improved by the acid treatment of activated carbon as well as carbon black supports. A selection of samples were also characterized by means of inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to study the hydrogen-related features of the acid modification of the carbon supports. Indications for different sensitivities of the final Pd/C-catalysts to catalytically driven hydrogasification effects of the supports and the impact of these effects on the precious metal dispersion and the formation of Pd-hydrides were obtained. The formation of molecular-like polyaromatic structures was observed especially on HCl-treated activated carbon due to enhanced spillover of active hydrogen from the Pd-particles to adjacent sites on the support. The generation and accessability of these sites on the support seems to be promoted by the removal of ash and adsorbed species.",

More than three hundred LENR papers from 1989 to 2008 that reported excess energy were acquired and reviewed to extract quantitative results and other information. Excess energies and cell volumes were found in 17 papers. These data were used to compute eV per water molecule values. Most experiments showed excess energy outputs that would lead to ratios below the vibrational energy of water molecules at room temperature (0.04 eV/molecule). However, 65% of the papers, which reported both excess energies and cell volumes, indicated values significantly higher. The highest  reported value was 42.6 eV/molecule. Eleven ratios are far beyond what is plausible for water to be the source of anomalous heat.

For all the temperatures in the 150-350 K range and for all the energies between 150 and 250 eV, the formation of microcracks increases the probability of fusion compared to non-deformed lattices, and also reduces the thickness of the Coulomb barrier. Using the trend of the curve of potential to evaluate the influence of the concentration of impurities, a very high barrier is found within the pure lattice (J ? 0.25%). However, under the same thermodynamic conditions, the probability of fusion in the impure metal (J ? 0.75%) could be higher, with a total energy less than the potential so that the tunneling effect is amplified.

On the consideration of the finite size of the nucleus, the third wave function does not diverge while r approaches to zero. Its radial wave function has below characteristics: (1) the angular-momentum quantum number l must be greater than the principal quantum number n; (2) l must not be 0 or 1; (3) the electron-cloud distribution differs from the traditional one; (4) the electron is closer to the nucleus by comparison with that in traditional results.

Previous theoretical models for the nuclear force include only the Coulomb electric force of the protons, but with little or no consideration of the electromagnetic characteristics of the quarks. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve predictions of binding energy better than any previous model, doing so by using only one variable instead of five.

Of particular interest are cathodes and particulate Pd which had experienced episodes of excess heat production beyond all electrical and other inputs. This paper details the careful analysis by neutron activation analysis (NAA) of a set of three samples of finely powdered Pd exposed to high deuterium pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) near room temperature at the core of hollow cylindrical Pd cathodes. A fourth sample of unused Pd powder from the same batch used in the cathodes was analyzed as a control. The most prominent change observed in the three active samples versus the virgin Pd was the Zn-64 content. The active samples showed an increase in the Zn-64 isotope of 6 to 14 times that in the virgin Pd. Speculation regarding the source of this increased zinc varies from contamination during electron beam welding (used to seal off the hollow core) to nuclear reactions generated by high pressure deuterium gas on the large surface area Pd particles in the core.",

The surface energy required to rupture the palladium temporarily prevents the escape of the reactants during their accumulation secondary to the catastrophic reactions, and thereby maintains close contact for the desired reactions.

The most studied system (palladium/deuterium) has given birth to the \"Cold Fusion\" concept: a special kind of DD fusion reaction, only occurring in a metallic lattice, which yields heat and helium-4 as the main reaction product. Other systems have also been studied (nickel hydrogen and caesium/deuterium for instance), showing shifts in isotopic ratio of the products of reaction and leading to the more generalized concept of Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR). A novel conjecture (the pico-gravity conjecture) is presented here, that may explain all the anomalies observed in this so-called \"Cold Fusion\" field. According to this conjecture, the main part of the energy produced in Low Energy Nuclear Reaction could be the result of a very special kind of chemical reactions (pico-chemical reactions), induced by a considerable increase of gravity at pico-meter distances (pico-gravity). True nuclear signatures (\u03b1-particles emission for instance) could also occur according to the pico-gravity conjecture. But they should be many orders of magnitude lower than would be expected from the energy produced (which is observed experimentally).

This paper first reviews reports in the literature of meltdowns or explosions that might have been caused by LENR. Then, each of the three areas cited above is examined.

The system is placed in a chamber filled with deuterium gas, at a temperature of 75?C. At first, deuterium fills the two anodes up to D/Pd = 0.48 measured by pressure decrease. Then a voltage is applied between cathode and anodes, and the cathode gets loaded by D+ electrochemical migration through the solid state electrolyte. Correspondingly, the pressure decreases. Loadings of up to 0.73 have been obtained. When voltages are reversed, the cathode deloads, and the pressure in the chamber increases. This method is well suited to measure over-potentials and absolute loadings.

In a spherical bubble compression and until the bubble assumes a pancake collapse shape, a temperature increase does not occur in the bubble gas because the mean free path likely exceeds the bubble diameter. The subsequent collapse of the pancake shape to liquid density occurs with only a negligible volume change so that the temperature increase for compression heating of bubble gases is insignificant. Even near liquid density, a temperature increase does not occur as the energy transfer by molecular collisions is in the adiabatic limit for both vibrational and rotational modes. Instead, the IR radiation energy density present within the bubble is increased as required to satisfy standing wave boundary conditions with the bubble walls in the direction of collapse. For biological tissue in an opaque environment, bubble collapse is found to increase the 5- 10 micron I R thermal radiation at ambient temperature to about 3-5 e V that is capable of dissociating the water molecule and forming the chemically reactive hydroxyl radical. Hence, the biological effects of ultrasonic cavitation are proposed to be caused by the chemical reaction of the organisms with the excited electronic states of dissolved oxygen and water molecules.",

These factors may have a determinative influence on the triggering of the diffusional effects, influencing not only the D/Pd ratio, but also internal cracking. Information on the relation between the surface characteristics and the fugacity may point to us conditions for the initiation of fusion.In the present paper an interim report is given on the results of about on and one-half year's work of one sub-group at Texas A&M.",

However, published accounts on elemental change in solids have been around since before the discovery of the nucleus. Thus, the earliest evidence for creation of new elements was that reported for reactions in biological systems. In view of the wave of negative opinion against the 1989 and thereafter work, it is interesting to note a U.S. Army report of 1978 which concluded that the evidence for nuclear reactions in biology was strongly positive. Even less well-known is that U.S. government labs in the 1970s experimented with neutron emission arising from the passage of very high currents through wires, conditions under which thermonuclear reactions should not have been occurring.",

In general terms, the reactions can be described as fusion when two hydrogen isotopes combine to form a single product nuclei or as transmutation when one or more hydrogen isotope nuclei enter a larger nuclei. As expected, these reactions generate energy but very little radiation is detected, which is unexpected and has been a cause for rejection.? Sufficient evidence is now available to justify believing this is a real phenomenon and not the result of error. The challenge is to explain how such an unusual process operates. The approached used in this paper is based on six assumptions and their logical relationship to many observations. Although many details are not quantified, the general characteristics of the LENR process are described. This analysis places severe limits on any proposed explanation.",

If this system can be developed for utility applications, high-grade heat and high thermodynamic efficiencies can be expected. Since the electrolyte provides a very reducing environment, metal surface oxides are readily removed; thus, this unique system offers the possibility of using less expensive materials than Pd.

There are few analytical methods that can detect trace amounts of 4He in the presence of D2. Most commercial magnetic sector mass spectrometers are large and expensive and, while they have excellent ?m/m resolution, they still require some additional separation of He, such as a getter system to achieve ppb sensitivity. We have developed a lower cost, compact system that allows us to measure 4He down to sub ppm levels in D2 and other gasses. This system utilizes a column of activated carbon cooled with liquid nitrogen (LN2) that effectively absorbs everything but helium. Post absorption, the system uses an MKS Microvision residual gas analyzer (RGA) and a Stanford Research Systems (SRS) RS 100 RGA to check for helium purity. The helium eluted from the column is quantified by a small magnetic sector mass spectrometer tuned to mass 4. A typical sample size required to achieve ppb sensitivity to 4He is 50 cm3 at 50 Torr. Calibrations have been done with air, 4He in D2 at various concentrations and show a 3% variation from standard sample to standard sample.

At high loading near room temperature, the gas pressure must be very high, and an ideal gas law no longer applies. In this case a knowledge of the fugacity is required to interpret and understand the results. We examine empirical models for the equation of state and fugacity of H2 which are relevant to the high pressure regime of interest, including an old model of Holley et al (1958), and the more modern models of Spycher and Reed (1988), Tkacz and Litwiniuk (2002), and Joubert (2010). At high pressure the more recent models are best, but the model of Tkacz and Litwiniuk diverges from the ideal gas equation of state at low pressure, which leads to an offset in the fugacity. We examine the difference between the equation of states for H2 and D2 in recent models, and find that the small difference at high pressure in the models of Tkacz and Litwiniuk agree best with experiment, while the larger difference in the models of Joubert (2010) and Joubert and Thiebaut (2011) is probably not reliable. We examine the possibility of developing a difference correction for the fugacity theoretically.

The present study was devoted to replicating and controlling that excess heat effect. The reactant is phenanthrene, a heavy oil fraction, which is subjected to high pressure and high heat in the presence of a metal catalyst. This results in the production of excess heat and strong penetrating electromagnetic radiation. After the reaction, an analysis of residual gas reveals a variety of hydrocarbons, but it seems unlikely that these products can explain the excess heat.

This reproducibility has allowed us to narrow the optimum conditions for the experiment. While this experiment is rather different from the \"standard\" electrolytic cell or the Ti gas hydride experiment, similarities exist in that non equilibrium conditions are sought and the tritium generation levels are low and neutron emission is extremely weak.

During experiments, dV/dt rapid changes were noted in volumes of proton and deuteron capturing an electron as the initial temperature cools. This is a very basic event at the atomic level. The D+ + e-D* will produce a shockwave that is only compressive for the elemental hydrogen isotopes. The shock wave that destroys the MC cluster of deuterons in a squeezing process, ends with an explosion that excites the MC debris. An excited state occurs where a free MC deuteron combines with the D*forming an alpha as part of the debris system for that cycle. He4 was collected in the Ar gas phase for a mass spectroscopy analysis, MS. Only the 3 hydrogen isotopes have the potential of the large dV/dt compression.Old measurements of the sonoluminescence (SL) photons emitted during DOD cavitation fits RF experiments, and it was never thought He4 might be associated with SL. But a closer look makes a case that SL and gamma photons were the same. The RF system during DOD cavitation could be associated with the improbable equation 2D He4 + g. The measured SL fits the RF He4 MS measurements. The advantage of the RF amplifier driven system was its freedom of a locked frequency of the oscillator driven systems and can be frequency tuned while running. The system could be tuned off for 5 s temperature measurement in the 30 s run mode, thus avoiding the high RF field interference to thermocouple measurements.

The emission rate amounts to about 27.2 ? 11.2 neutrons s^-l, which is equivalent to about 700 times as much as the background level. Neither excess heat nor tritium anomalies were, however, observed. The reason for the lack of repeatability of these experimental results is discussed.",

The focus was on all elements for which NAA is appropriate and sensitive. Although it is known that electrolysis deposits impurity metals on cathodic surfaces from the electrolyte (lithium deuteroxide in this case), this occurs only at the external surface of the rod. The samples were cut diametrally to minimize the surface relative to the bulk or interior portion of the cathode. Large increases in iron and zinc of a factor of 56 and 12 respectively were observed in the active cathode relative to the virgin material. Smaller but significant increases were observed for chromium, cobalt, and cesium. In addition, the Pd-110/Pd-108 ratios were determined. Preliminarily, it appears that Pd-108 was depleted in the active cathode relative to Pd-110 as compared with that ratio in the virgin material. Possible sources of these changes in addition to the conventional explanations are discussed.",

Electrolysis of a D20 solution containing IOmM S^2- produced \"burst-like\" excess heat up to 14% over 12 hours after 6 days' electrolysis. The production of excess heat was absent from a control experiment using LiOH/H2O in the place of LiOD/D2O. It seemed that the magnitude and reproducibility of the excess heat production were improved by the addition of S^2- to the electrolyte solutions. In this study, in situ observations of topographic changes at electrode surfaces during the electrolysis were also conducted using phase measurement interferometric microscopy (PMIM). The absorption of hydrogen into a Pd cathode was clearly seen to bring about surface roughening even at a very low hydrogen content of less than H/Pd=0.005. Original surface topography was readily restored by desorbing hydrogen from the Pd electrode by using it as the anode. The absorption and desorption of deuterium similarly induced the reversible surface topography change. The extent of the surface roughening due to the hydrogen absorption varied with electrode materials and crystal facets of Pd single crystals.",

Using small size X-ray beam in 100- and 500-micrometer squares, we obtained 2 dimensional XRF spectra for three permeated samples, from which we detected Pr. Pr was detected again by the two small x-ray beams as expected. The amount of Pr varied greatly at different locations of the Pd surface, however, a clear correlation between surface structures and distribution of Pr has not seen up to now.

    "abstract": "Within a few months of the Fleischmann Pons announcement of 1989 several independent groups at BARC had confirmed the production of neutrons and tritium in a variety of electrolytic cells. Among the many findings of the BARC groups were the first hint of the neutron to tritium branching ratio anomaly, namely that tritium production is several orders of magnitude higher than that of neutrons, that neutrons and tritium are probably being emitted simultaneously and that at least in the case of titanium targets, the generated tritium is found to be entrenched in highly localized \"hot spots\". But the most intriguing observation of all was that neutrons appeared to be emitted in sharp bursts of up to 10^3 neutrons per event. An integrated view of all these findings taken together led to the speculation that perhaps up to 10^10-10^12 tritons each were being generated in the form of micro-nuclear explosions, with neutron emission being only a minor side reaction in the process. Whatever the nature of the phenomenon, it seemed to be occurring in a highly localized fashion, both in space and time. Since those early days however the aspect of spatially localized occurrence of nuclear reactions has gained further acceptance through the concept of \"Nuclear Active Environment\". The observation of thermal hot spots, micro-craters and isolated regions wherein transmutation products are concentrated on the cathode surface has reinforced the suspicion that the phenomenon is spatially localized. But how reliable is the evidence for localization in time? This review revisits our early neutron multiplicity measurements since it appears that confirmation of multiple neutron production is possibly the only handle we have to establish the temporal localization feature and thereby give some insight into the possible occurrence of micro-nuclear explosions which in turn would have a tremendous bearing on the nature of the theoretical mechanism governing these LENR reactions.",

It is a fascinating story that offers lessons for the struggling New Energy community. Sad to say, the very next month, on May 30, 1912, Wilbur Wright died of typhoid fever. His brother, Orville, who had piloted the first flight, lived on to 1948.",

The calculation is performed under the frame work of density functional theory. The results provide new insight into the charge state of H inside Pd. The H is slightly negatively charged over the composition range studied in this paper, and the negative charge around the proton increases with an increasing loading in hydrogen. By studying the behavior of H at the \"bridging\" site, which is also important to surface configuration, this paper helps explain why the effective charge observed in H drift experiments is different from the static charge state.",

In the bombardment experiments, the cross sections for d(d,p)t reactions were measured to be less than 1.5 x 10-11 b at an ion energy of 2 keV. Measured branching ratios between d(d,p)t and d(d,niHe were unity in the ion energy range between 2 and 40 keY, even though the deuterium-deuterium nuclear fusion occurred in palladium. We also estimated the minimum detectable values for the charged-particle detection system, NE213 nuclear detector system, 3He counter, and a quadrupole mass-spectroscope system used in both the experiments. In the deuterium transport experiments, we tried to detect nuclear fusion products by using these detector systems placed in a vacuum chamber which extracted deuterium from the sample palladium. Any extraordinary nuclear products, however, could not be observed in the experiments carried out under various temperature variations and for various modifications of palladium surfaces.",

The regular solutions of these equations are the basis for modern quantum mechanical predictions for comparison with the experimental values of atomic-electron orbital energies. The other solution, discussed in the literature for over 55 years, is relativistic and considered anomalous because its predicted levels are very deep (up to 511 keV) and have never been observed. Nevertheless, the existence of these deep levels provides a ready explanation of the mechanism for penetration of the Coulomb barrier and the means of D?D fusion below the 4He fragmentation levels. Since these levels also provide the basis for all of the other cold fusion observations (both PdD and NiH systems), it is important that arguments for and against the Dirac model be examined. The theoretical support for this anomalous solution is provided in a companion paper in this conference. This presentation seeks: to update the deep-orbit information provided in a poster at ICCF-17, to describe the nature of these deep?Dirac levels (DDLs), to report on additional, but unpublished, results presented by Va?vra in 1998, and to correct some interpretations of the model that Va?vra has provided in 2013. There are some unusual properties of the DDLs relative to those of the known atomic orbitals. Interpretation of the DDL properties, based on the non-relativistic solutions, leads to misunderstandings and further rejection of the concept of the deep levels. We hope to clarify this situation and indicate the importance of the calculations for cold fusion models. Cold fusion results provide a basis for understanding the DDLs and the proposed new fields of femto-physics and femto-chemistry.",

This paper presents the observation of 3H and mantle helium in the crater Lakes Nemrut (Turkey), Laacher (Germany) and Pavin (France). The presence of excess 3H in the lakes can be explained as material released from mantle sources because of the correlation of excess 3H with mantle 3He and 4He. The helium concentration was much higher in the bottom layers of the lakes. The 4He and 3He concentrations in Lakes Nemrut, Laacher, and Pavin were determined to be 25 and 190; 10 and 50; and 70 and 500 times larger than the atmospheric saturation value, respectively. The isotopic ratio of the excess helium, 3Heex/4Heex, in Lakes Nemrut, Laacher and Pavin was (1.032?0.006)?10^-5, (7.42?0.03)?10^-6 and (9.09?0.01)?10^6 respectively. The ratios clearly indicate that large amounts of helium isotopes are released to the lakes from a mantle source.

Finally, we describe the use of these models in a numerical simulation of the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. In these models a bottleneck occurs associated with helium diffusion out of the active region. We find that if the active region is thin (100 nm or less) that helium diffusion is fast, and excess heat production can occur in a steady state mode. If the active region is thick (500 nm or greater), then helium diffusion is slow and excess heat in these models occurs in bursts.",

To account for this we have proposed new models in which coherent energy exchange occurs between two-level systems with a large energy quantum, and an oscillator with a much smaller characteristic energy. In earlier work we demonstrated using perturbation theory that the lossy spin-boson model is capable of efficient coherent energy exchange when many oscillator quanta are exchanged for a two-level system quanta on resonance. Here we introduce a formulation that isolates nearly degenerate states in the lossy spin-boson model, and allows the computation of the self-energy and indirect coupling matrix elements. From calculations of simple lossy spin boson models we establish a scaling law and define the dimensionless coupling constant g for the system. Direct calculations using this approach is not possible for large models in which a great many oscillator quanta are exchanged, but the formulation provides a foundation for understanding this kind of model, and will allow us to develop more powerful approximate methods.",

Correlations between the material status and the occurrence of the effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades, in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producing the excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clear explanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required to define the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, specific work has been carried out to investigate whether the excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probes and triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladium samples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminary results highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, and the importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.",

Some of the reported results have been interpreted as a result of achieving thermonuclear fusion temperatures (~a few keV) during acoustic bubble cavitation (ABC).? We propose an alternative theoretical model for the ABC fusion based on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism. Our theoretical model yields two main predictions.? The first prediction is that the Coulomb interaction between two charged bosons is suppressed for the case in which number N of charged bosons is large, and hence the conventional Gamow factor is absent. The second prediction is that the fusion rate depends on the probability of the BEC ground state occupation instead of the conventional Gamow factor.? This implies that the fusion rate will increase as the temperature of the system is lowered since the probability of the BEC state is larger at lower temperatures.? These predictions imply that the ABC fusion may be achievable at lower temperatures. A number of key improvement to acoustic cavitation experiments are proposed to check these predictions as well as the results of other experiments.",

Metallurgical examination of some of the electrodes showed extensive damage associated with deuterium loading. Surfaces have been found to be covered with large number of impurities. Initiation and sustaining these heat bursts, monitoring of nuclear products and materials aspects of these electrolytic cells have been the focus of our current efforts. As D/Pd loading appear to be critical, the measurement of deuterium loading using dilatometry as a function of current density, surface and heat treatment of the cathode and poisoning are currently being investigated.",

    "abstract": "Numerous reports on gas loading of hydrogen isotope into powdered materials indicate excess heat generation that could be the result of a low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). When the amount of generated heat is small, it is important to characterize the calorimeter to account for possible measurement errors, or artifacts, which can result in long-term apparent excess heat. In this paper we investigate one of those possible measurement artifacts applicable to the gas loading systems that (1) use thermometry as a proxy for energy flow measurements, and (2) run at elevated temperatures. When loading gas into Pd-impregnated alumina, we have found that thermal gradients inside the system result in apparent heating or cooling of the measuring system. We experimentally magnified this effect and confirmed that it was due to temperature nonuniformity inside the calorimetric system. We quantified the effect using a numerical simulation tool to show that a temperature gradient as small as 0.5 K/m might result in 50 mW of apparent excess heat\"generation\". We suggest a simple approach for investigators to account for this measurement artifact by calibrating their systems with helium gas either prior to, or at the end of, the experimental sequence.",

The enabling process is non-nuclear and is one of controlling the Deuterium (D) chemical potential. After surpassing a high threshold D chemical potential, some of the true deuterium reactants, Dx's, are able to form. The formation of the new Dx's involves a change of state of the D's which reduces their repulsion forces and increases the probability of spontaneous fusion events. Once some of the Dx's are in place, there, indeed, is coupling between the non-nuclear and nuclear processes as shown by the experimental measurement of the heat produced.In this paper, existing experimental data are used to show how to enable and control the heat-producing process. A gas-loading technique is employed to achieve the required high D chemical potential and a reactor design and development program is outlined.",

The anomalous radiation would appear within a few hours in the co-deposition experiments where the palladium is loaded with deuterium as it deposits from solution. In contrast, the appearance of anomalous radiation required days of electrolysis for the palladium rods that load much slower.

Reproducibility continues to be the major problem in this controversial research area. Based on our experiments, this lack of reproducibility stems from unknown variables in the palladium metal. The best reproducibility for excess power was obtained using palladium-boron materials supplied by the Naval Research Laboratory. Our basic isoperibolic calorimeters were capable of measuring excess power with a sensitivity of ?1% of the input power or ?20 mW, whichever was larger. Calorimeters that are capable of detecting excess power levels of 1 watt per cubic centimeter of palladium are essential for research in this field. Results from our laboratory indicate that helium-4 is the missing nuclear product accompanying the excess heat. Thirty out of 33 experiments showed a correlation between either excess power and helium production or no excess power and no excess helium. The collection of the electrolysis gases in both glass and metal flasks place the helium production rate at 10^11 to 10^12 atoms per second per watt of excess power. This is the correct magnitude for typical deuteron fusion reactions that yield helium-4 as a product. Anomalous radiation was defected in some experiments by the use of X-ray films, Geiger-Mueller counters, and by the use of sodium iodide detectors.

Four different calibration procedures were used including a blank using a platinum cathode. Temperature gradients were monitored and found to change when excess heat was produced. This change strongly suggests that normal electrolysis releases energy mainly at the anode while excess heat is released mainly at the cathode. The bulk D/Pd ratio was measured during initial charging and was found to reach 0.82. Voltage difference between cathode and reference electrode was measured and indicates that the deuterium concentration gradient is small during initial charging at 0.02A/cm^2.

Mass spectrum analysis of upper-cell gas and palladium cathode by a quadrupole mass spectrometer and tritium measurement in a sampled electrolyte were done by off-line techniques.Excess heats up to approximately 4 to 5W were produced with the cold worked and copper layered (0.95 /.1 m) cathode. However, during excess heat, nuclear products (neutrons) were not observed over the 3 a limit line of background level. In a few mass spectrum analyses, slight increases of helium-4 peaks were observed. However, helium-4 might not absolutely increase, because it was difficult to calibrate the mass spectrometer to deduce total amount of helium-4 from samples.",

The investigation covers the potential range -1.2 to +0.4 V measured vs. an Ag/AgCl reference. It was found that a coupled, twolayer model of the interphase describes the observed behavior as a function of scan rate and electrolyte composition.

This paper reevaluates some of the factual bases for the scientific and management judgments of 1989 with the advantage of what has been learned after four years of worldwide experimentation and analysis. We conclude that there is an FPE and its signature is heat. Data existed in 1989 that could have lead to this conclusion. The source of the excess heat is still not understood. Scientific progress was not made through this debate, which was largely uninformed by appropriate experimentation, and patent considerations may have played a determining role in the scientific progress associated with the FPE.",

    "abstract": "The biggest theoretical problem associated with excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment in our view has been the absence of energetic particles in amounts commensurate with the energy produced. In response we have pursued models in which the large nuclear energy quantum is fractionated into a great many lower energy quanta. To connect these idealized models to the physical system we need to evaluate the associated coupling matrix elements. Recently we have found a new coupling mechanism that arises when a lattice model is derived starting from a Dirac description of individual nucleons; this coupling mechanism can be considered a generalization of spin-orbit coupling and produces interactions between the center of mass dynamics and internal nuclear degrees of freedom. In this work we develop a simplified model for 4He and molecular D2 states with which we evaluate the phonon exchange matrix element for D2/4He transitions based on the new interaction. We restrict our calculation to the central and tensor contributions of the Hamada-Johnston nucleon-nucleon potential, which are the strongest, and find coupling between ground state 4He and triplet P and F molecular states. This interaction matrix element can be used in generalized lossy spin-boson models for the calculation of excess heat production in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment.",

    "abstract": "Unusual nuclear transmutation reactions have been reported by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). In their experiment, D2  gas permeates through a Pd complexes, which consists of a thin Pd layer, alternating CaO and Pd layers and bulk Pd. When they used sample Pd complexes with additional Cs on the surface, Pr emerged on the surface while Cs decreased after the sample was subjected to D2  gas permeation at 343 K and 1 atm for about one week. The elemental analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This phenomenon was reproduced qualitatively in the present replication experiment.We performed D-permeation experiments similar to the MHI?s experiment three times, and we confirmed the production of Pr. Pd complex samples were provided to us by MHI. The surface was electrolytically cleaned to remove hydrocarbons before depositing Cs. D2  gas was permeated through the Pd complexes at 343 K and 1 atm for about 5 days. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed to analyze the existence of the elements (Cs and Pr) and the mass distribution. The results showed the existence of Pr. And we also confirmed the existence of Pr by using fast Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) in Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS) of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI).As a result, we confirmed that the nuclear transmutation reaction, from 133Cs to 141Pr, was occurred. This transmutation suggests that the mass numbers and atomic numbers increase 8 and 4, respectively. The model of multi-body resonance fusion of deuterons proposed by A. Takahashi2 can explain this mass-8-and-charge-4 increased transmutation.",

The density of tracks registered by a CR-39 detector was found to be of a magnitude that provides undisputable evidence of their nuclear origin. The experiments were reproducible. A model based upon electron capture is proposed to explain the reaction products observed in the Pd/D-D2O system.",

The titanium chips were cooled and loaded with deuterium at 77 K and then rapidly heated to 323 K. The rapid heating produces a large pressure increase inside the crystalline lattice of the host metal. An Event Timer/Counter (ETC) card was designed and developed which counted and kept a time distribution of the neutron pulses as they occurred from a helium-3 neutron counter embedded in a paraffin moderator [1]. The experiment produced copious neutron counts. During one cooling and heating cycle, over 2 million neutrons were counted over a 5 min time period. In subsequent cooling and heating cycles using the same titanium chips, significant neutron bursts were observed with diminishing counts after each subsequent cycle. This paper will discuss the 1991 experiments and the status of ongoing experiments.",

Nevertheless, we are still confronted with a problem: the theoretical basis of LENR are not known and, as a matter of fact, little research has been carried out on this subject. In this work we seek to analyse the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of Preparata?s model of the palladium lattice [5,15]. We will also show the occurrence probability of fusion phenomena according to more accurate experiments [6]. We are not going to use any of the research models which have been previously followed in this field. Our aim is to demonstrate the theoretical possibility of cold fusion. Moreover, we will focus on tunneling the existent Coulomb barrier between two deuterons. Analysing the possible contributions of the lattice to the improvement of the tunneling probability, we find that there is a real mechanism through which this probability could be increased: this mechanism is the screening effect due to d-shell electrons of palladium lattice. The accordance between theoretical and experimental results will prove the reality of cold fusion phenomena and show the reliability of our model.",

In particular, so called gap DBs, which can arise in diatomic crystals such as metal hydrides, are argued to be the LENR catalyzers. The large mass difference between H or D and the metal atoms provides a gap in phonon spectrum, in which DBs can be excited in the H/D sub-lattice resulting in extreme dynamic closing of adjacent H/D atoms (\" 0.01 ?) required for the tunneling through the nuclear Coulomb barrier. DBs have been shown to arise either by thermal activation at elevated temperatures or by knocking atoms out of equilibrium positions under non-equilibrium gas loading conditions, employed under radiolysis or plasma deposition methods. The DB statistics in both cases are analyzed, and an attempt is made to quantify part of the vibrational problem in terms of electrochemical current or ion flux, connecting them with external excitation of DBs that act as nano-colliders of deuterons, triggering LENR. Resulting analytical expressions (under a selected set of material parameters) describe quantitatively the observed exponential dependence on temperature and linear dependence on the electric (or ion) current.

The lattice constraints and slow collision processes, force the ions into a near 1-D configuration that deepens the electron ground-state potential well. This permits the electron pair to remain closely bound to one deuteron and to do work in bringing the D- D+ pair together. These tightly-bound electrons may remain as a pair, attached to a single deuteron, during the fusion process. In reducing the Coulomb repulsion of the nuclear protons, these electrons bring down the total energy of the fusing D- D+ pair and raise the fragmentation energy level. This process accounts for the observations in CMNS of excess heat (in both p-p and d-d reactions) and for the differing observations (or their absence) of tritium, 3He, neutrons, and 4He in the d-d reaction.

It is conjectured the craters result from violent reactions, perhaps of nuclear origin. Nagel proposed acorrelation between the crater diameter and the energy involved in its formation. Starting from this assumption, it can be estimated that the enthalpy released can raise the temperature of the crater content to about 2000 K. A simple model is used to calculate the crater cooling by conduction and radiation. It gives the order of magnitude of the maximum event duration in order to achieve some melting of the cathode material. The duration of the eruption is estimated from the gas pressure developed within the crater. A value of 6 ns is obtained for a 2?m diameter, and 600 ns for a 20?m crater. In large craters, a part of inner material can be molten. Small craters are strongly cooled by the surrounding metal and do not show signs of fusion.",

The process of optimization of nuclear fusion reactions is associated with the formation of coherent correlated states of protons and deuterons, which leads to a short-term generation of very large fluctuations in the momentum and energy ofthese particles, and occurs under the action of shock waves and impulse changes of the magnetic field of the star.

The peak could be seen in almost every run of experiment. The counts of this peak kept almost constant ratio (about 0. 07) with the D-D proton peak that took place within the deuteron implanting ?range. Therefore, this unknown peak was considered as charged particle from unknown reaction (e.g. proton/rom D-D fusion) that occurred deeply (beyond the deuteron range) inside the palladium target plate. The reaction should be induced by some other trigger conditions except the direct beam-target effect of deuteron implantation. Similar phenomena were also observed, while the Ti. Fe, Ni. Cu and Mo foils (plates) were applied as targets, but the depth profiles of the reaction zones were quite different for different targets. Temperature of target has made some influence on reaction place. Both of cluster ion (D3+) and isolated deuteron (D+) beams were applied to the experiment. The results have shown that each isolated deuteron could induce higher rate of unknown reaction, compared with each deuteron of cluster ion beam. The experimental results show that the unknown reaction had some kind of dependence on ion states, target materials, temperature, deuterium loading ratio, etc. conditions. These factors are similar to the usually considered key factors in other type cold fusion experiments. There might be some relations between this unknown reaction and Cold Fusion phenomena, but further identification is necessary to find the origin of the peak and the relation with CF phenomena.",

However, the resulting screening energies differ strongly for diverse host metals and different experiments. Here, we present new experimental results and investigations of interfering processes in the irradiated targets. These measurements inside metals set special challenges and pitfalls that make them and the data analysis particularly error prone. There are multiparameter collateral effects that are crucial for the correct interpretation of the observed experimental yields. They mainly originate from target surface contaminations owing to residual gases in the vacuum as well as from inhomogeneities and instabilities in the deuteron density distribution in the targets. To address these problems an improved differential analysis method beyond the standard procedures has been implemented. Profound scrutiny of the other experiments demonstrates that the observed unusual changes in the reaction yields are mainly due to deuteron density dynamics simulating the alleged screening energy values. The experimental results are compared with different theoretical models of the electron screening in metals. The Debye-H?ckel model that has been previously proposed to explain the influence of the electron screening on both nuclear reactions and radioactive decays can be clearly excluded.",

The thermodynamic properties of the micro drops in a bubble,where the pressure is 1 atm, is represented by Laplace's equation, i.e. the pressure(P)-volume(V) curves for various temperatures and the pressure-temperature(T) curves for various volume are drawn. The P-V and P-T curves demand the presence of the surface structure of the liquid and is named here as super water. The P-T curve shows a negative slope increasing as the volume decreases.This property is analysed by the third Maxwell's thermodynamic equation that the entropy is negative . When a microdrop receives a negative pressure the phase change from the normal water to the super water occurs and heat is generated. As the actuation is not by energy,the heat is excess heat. This occurs in both light and heavy water. The cold fusion arises in the minimum microdrop of heavy water under high actuation,as the super liquid is supposed to be liquid plasma and violent concussion is given there. Another effect of the negative pressure to the microdrop is to make it work by increasing the volume like an engine. An actuated microdrop synthesizes a new material whose resolution heat is equivalent to that released in the absence of the synthesis.",

The diffusivity of hydrogen in palladium was measured using standard transient techniques in the initial region of low current density. Combining this value with the measured value of diffusion current at the plateau level gave a concentration of hydrogen at the entrance surface of the palladium that was the same for three different palladium thicknesses, and was equal to the saturation value in \u03b1 palladium. It is proposed that this can be used as a known and reproducible effective hydrogen pressure (0.019 atm) if palladium is plated onto other metals before measuring their permeability in an electrochemical cell. Experimental evidence for this was obtained from permeability measurements made on several thicknesses of iron. Permeation studies were also made on AISI 410 stainless steel and tin plated mild steel. The measured value for electrolytic tinplate was 107 times that expected from extrapolation of high temperature data.

This precise evaluation of the rate of enthalpy generation relies on the non-linear regression fitting of the \"black-box\" model of the calorimeter to an extensive set of temperature time measurements. The method of data analysis gives a systematic underestimate of the enthalpy output and, in consequence, a slightly negative excess rate of enthalpy generation for an extensive set of blank experiments using both light and heavy water. By contrast, the electrolysis of heavy water at palladium electrodes shows a positive excess rate of enthalpy generation; this rate increases markedly with current density, reaching values of approximately 100 W cm^-3 at approximately 1 A cm^-2. It is also shown that prolonged polarization of palladium cathodes in heavy water leads to bursts in the rate of enthalpy generation; the thermal output of the cells exceeds the enthalpy input (or the total energy input) to the cells by factors in excess of 40 during these bursts. The total specific energy output during the bursts as well as the total specific energy output of fully charged electrodes subjected to prolonged polarization (5-50 MJ cm^-3) is 10^2 - 10^3 times larger than the enthalpy of reaction of chemical processes.",

Multibody resonance fusion of deuterons was proposed by modeling charged-pion exchange for strong interaction in very condensed deuteron cluster to lead to select the tetrahedral resonance fusion (TRF) of 4D and octahedral resonance fusion (ORF) of 8D as possible major reaction channels in extreme case. 4He is the final product of TRF and ORF.

A survey of the literature indicates that palladium particles less than 2 nm in size can obtain a Pd/D loading near one at modest deuterium pressure. In hundreds of reactions, we have routinely prepared palladium nanoparticles inside an aluminosilicate matrix and have found that these systems produce up to 8 fold more heat with deuterium compared to hydrogen. Furthermore, a characteristic signature of a pressurization reaction is its reversibility -- the heat released upon pressurization should be absorbed upon evacuation. This reversibility is observed with hydrogen but not deuterium. Although we are still seeking conventional explanations for this excess heat, the anomalous heat does not appear to be explained by impurities in the deuterium gas nor other simple chemical or physical sources.

Significant excess power was produced from the cells using the Pd-B and Pd-Ce alloy cathodes. The Pd-Ce-B alloy, in contrast, showed no measureable excess power effects. Previous experiments at China Lake using similar Pd-B alloy cathodes prepared by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) produced excess heat in seven out of eight experiments. The same Pd-Ce cathode that was used at NHE also produced significant excess power in previous experiments at China Lake. Due to the controversy over methods of data analysis for the F-P cells (see ICCF-5 Proceedings, 1995, pp. 105-115), I developed my own methods while at NHE. As I refined my methods for evaluating the calorimetric measurements, they approached more closely the methods outlined by Fleischmann and Pons in their Icarus Systems handbooks available at NHE. The method previously developed by NHE for the analysis of the F-P cells showed no excess heat for any of these same three experiments. The major problem with the NHE method is that a single calibration was used in determining the effective radiative heat transfer coefficient for the cell. An incorrect heat transfer coefficient can readily confuse the excess heat effect with the calorimetric error for the system. Calorimetric results for the same experiment using the NHE method, my method, and the F-P method for data analysis are compared. The fact that the alternative NHE method showed no excess heat for F-P cells illustrates the problem in transferring calorimetric methods from one laboratory to another. The second laboratory often fails to follow directions and makes changes that compromise the calorimetry. Similar problems were encountered in the attempt to transfer the China Lake calorimetry to NRL, hence excess heat was not observed.",

The behaviors of solid Pd, sintered Pd powder, and sintered Ni powder are discussed in this paper. The required deuterium ions can be made available to the LENR process by using electrolysis or exposure to D2 gas. Initiation of the nuclear reaction sometimes requires the creation of a large D/Pd ratio, but not always. In many cases, very little deuterium is required to produce detectable heating power, which is the thermal energy expressed in watts. In every case, the amount of power is not affected by the D/Pd ratio after the nuclear process starts. Also, increased temperature causes the amount of power to increase exponentially, with the activation energy being related to the source of deuterons available to the nuclear process. The reaction involving deuterium emits part of the nuclear energy as energetic ions having the characteristics of a hydrogen isotope, but not helium [1]. Very little photon radiation is detected outside the walls of the container in which the source is located. The behavior is consistent with the nuclear active environment (NAE) being in physical gaps having a critical width located outside the crystal structure, not in vacancies located within the lattice structure. Successful production of LENR involves the formation of these sites in high concentration and with reliability. This paper describes an effort to meet this challenge.",

Phonon exchange in the case of a much simpli\ufb01ed scalar Gaussian nuclear model is reviewed. The coupling of reactions at different sites is explored, and connections are made with recent experiments on alpha emission. The fastest site-other-site reactions are null reactions in which fusion reactions and their inverses are coupled.

Some preliminary results on core electron screening were reported before [1]. The studies focus on two types of nuclear reactions in some metal lattices: fusion between deuterons and also proton capture by medium and heavy lattice nuclei. In both reactions the energy of the light nuclear species, proton or deuteron, is on the KeV (1000 electron volts) scale, while that of heavy nuclei is essentially zero. A standard atomic code is used to obtain the core electron charge density and the potential profile in the metal atom. This Hartree-Fock-Slater type code was originally written by Herman and Skillman and later modified by others and available online. For the D-D reaction, the charge density obtained then gives an estimate on the screening length. The corresponding enhancement in Coulomb barrier tunneling can be obtained from this data.? For the proton capture reaction, an ion dynamic code written to simulate the motion of KeV protons in Pd/Ni lattice, CLAIRE, was modified to take into account the realistic atomic potential, including core electron contributions. In both cases, our result shows a significant nuclear reaction enhancement.

    "abstract": "Recent experimental evidences clearly indicate that the reproducibility of excess heat production is correlated with the cathode surface properties. To support the results, a theoretical frame has been also developed, that suggests that a relevant role in the excess heat production is played by the electrodynamics processes at the cathode interface. In particular, one of the mechanisms involved is the enhancement and spatial localization of the electro-magnetic field at the metal/electrolyte interface, promoted by proper surface roughness and morphology. A further point to be considered is the dynamic character of the metal/electrolyte interface during electrochemical deuterium loading, that derives from the coupling between the different interface characteristics. Surface reconstruction of the metallic cathode is expected to happen, due to corrosion-deposition mechanisms, D/H transport, stress relaxation and defect production, and so on. All these mechanisms both affect and are affected by the surface properties, such as the morphology of the metal/electrolyte interface, the metallurgical and crystal structure of the cathode and the presence of contaminants.",

    "abstract": "Low energy nuclear processes, which are strongly hindered by Coulomb repulsion between the reacting nuclei, are investigated in solid environment. It is shown that this hindering effect may be essentially weakened (it practically disappears) if one takes into account the Coulomb interaction of one of the reacting particles with the surroundings. It is obtained that if the modification of the wave function due to Coulomb interaction with charged constituents of the environment is taken into account applying standard perturbation calculation of quantum mechanics then waves of high momentum with small amplitude are mixed to the initial wave of small momentum. This may be interpreted as the slow, quasi-free heavy particle of positive charge pushes a heavy particle of the environment and they can obtain (virtually) such a great magnitude of momentum (of opposite direction) in the intermediate state in that the probability of nuclear reaction with another positively charged, slow, heavy particle significantly increases. This magnitude of (virtual) momentum is determined by energy and momentum conservation between initial and final states. The mechanism (called recoil assistance) opens the door to a great variety of nuclear processes that are now thought to have negligible rate at low energies. The recoil assisted nuclear $pd$ reaction is investigated like a sample reaction numerically. A partial overview of low energy nuclear reactions allowed by recoil assistance and leading to nuclear transmutations is presented. A critical analysis of Fleischmann-Pons type low energy nuclear reaction experiments is also presented.",

    "abstract": "In the period 1978?2002, The Silcal Metallurgic Ltd., a Coimbatore (India) based company, was engaged in the production of ferro silicon alloy deploying a 12 MVA \"Submerged Carbon Arc\" powered smelter. During a 11-week long non-stop round the clock operation of the plant in 1995, daily feed of raw materials was: Quartz (33.4 ton), charcoal (with fixed carbon content of 13.2 ton) and scrap steel (5.1 ton) while the daily output production of Fe?Si alloy (73.5% Si) was 24.75 ton. From the total weights of Si and Fe in the input feed and assuming 100% recovery of the metals, the daily output alloy production could at best have been only 20.5 ton. However to our surprise throughout the 11-week period the total daily Fe?Si alloy (with 73.5% Si) output was consistently 24.75 ton, corresponding to a daily \"anomalous\" excess metal production of 4.25 ton of Fe?Si alloy. The only source of Si entering the smelter furnace was the quartz raw material and that of Fe was the scrap steel (except for minor additional amounts of Fe originating from the steel casing of the consumable S?derberg carbon electrodes). Very careful vigil of the weights of daily input feed of raw materials and output alloy drained out as also the electrical energy consumption was maintained. It was evident that roughly 20% more metal than could be accounted for from the input feed was being produced and consequently we have been obliged to come to the conclusion that anomalous quantities of Si (2.8 ton/day) and Fe (1.45 ton/day) were being synthesized during the smelting process. Discussions with researchers involved in the Cold Fusion/LENR field have suggested that a likely explanation for the anomalous metal production could be the occurrence of transmutation reactions between nuclei of C and the O stripped from the SiO2 during the chemical reduction process. It is speculated that the intense varying magnetic fields generated by the kilo-amp levels of alternating current (AC) driving the arcing between the three gigantic carbon electrodes and the carbonic hearth of the furnace, in the 2000?C temperature environment, could have somehow catalyzed transmutation reactions to occur, very similar to the transmutations reported in laboratory scale \"Carbon-Arc experiments\" first revealed by George Oshawa in 1964. But the more puzzling aspect of our observations is that there was no evidence of release of the expected massive amounts of nuclear energy that should have accompanied the postulated transmutation reactions based on the atomic masses of the nuclei involved.",

Error sources in their experiments are discussed. There is possible evidence for excess power production in the Pd-D2O electrolysis experiments at one of these laboratories. A significant experimental problem in many isoperibolic calorimetric studies is the fact that the decrease in the electrolyte level due to electrolysis produces a significant decrease in the calorimetric cell constant if the temperature is measured in the electrolyte of the electrochemical cell. Furthermore, heat conduction pathways out of the top of the cell can produce large errors, especially at low power levels.

This mechanism, involving optical phonons and electric fields (internally or externally generated) in a lattice that induce the formation of H- H+ (D- D+) pairs, increases the tunneling probability by more than 100 orders of magnitude. It has additional major consequences.The lattice constraints and collision processes force the ions into a temporary, but cyclic, 1-D configuration that greatly deepens the electron ground-state potential well. The tightly-bound and energetic electron pair (a local-charged Boson - the lochon) becomes more than strong screening, it becomes a binding force between the nuclei. Thus, the Coulomb-barrier height is reduced as well as its length. With this greatly enhanced barrier-penetration probability, the energy level of nuclei with reasonable tunneling probability drops from the multi-100 keV range down into the eV range. . . .",

His horrific biography of Carlo Rubbia, Nobel Dreams, was an acid-etched portrait of scientist as brooding potential sociopath. When \"cold fusion\" arrived in March of 1989, Gary must have been delighted, for here was a subject perfect for his talented dissections of scientists. As most of us know, cold fusion, as announced in late March of 1989, applied initially to the proposed room temperature fusion reaction between two deuterium nuclei inside a palladium lattice. This deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion within the metal solid solution was postulated to create the same nuclear particles, electromagnetic radiation, and heat as the wellcharacterized D-D reactions within plasmas. I was eager to read his book because I know and respect the main characters, both pro and con warriors, in the cold fusion battles. When I opened his book, I turned to the index to see how various of my friends were treated. What I found was an enormous amount of imaginary detail, some of it negative, but not all of it. After just perusing the index for selected pages of text, I was initially quite puzzled why Gary flooded the facts in his text with this imaginary detail. As I began to read the text from the beginning, his reasons became clear. Garywas creating \"a combination soap opera and mystery\" that would lead to a best-seller. He was creating heroes and villains, continuity out of scattered facts, rich texture to his tale,\nand, incredibly, even a resolution of the mystery, in order to manufacture, or rather, to fabricate, a best-seller. Whatever one may think of the morality of presenting such a treatment as history, the book is a great read. ",

    "abstract": "Abstract-- Solids, at room temperature, are periodically ordered. High temperature plasma's (HTP's) are disordered. Because of this fact, collisions i n solids and HTP' s are very different. Specifically, because solids have periodic order, they can coherently absorb momentum, all at once at a point, discontinuously, and through recoil processes in which the solid, as a whole, moves in response to a collision at an isolated location. As a result, in ordered solids, very often, the initial momentum of \"colliding\" particles is not conserved by the particles during \"collisions. \" At lowlintermediate temperatures, these kinds of \"collisions\" play a dominant role i n the following important effects: 1 . the conduction of heat and electricity (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1 976A), 2. diffraction of neutrons, electrons and X-rays (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1 976B), and 3 . the Mossbauer effect (Schwinger, 1990; Schwinger, 1 994). Because the idealized limit of stoichiometric PdD is periodically ordered, not only is there reason to believe that further D-loading will result in the occupation of ion band states by D-nuclei. it is probable that the potential nuclear reactions and transport of ion band state D (Chubb and Chubb, 1 991) will be dominated by these kinds of interactions. . . .",

The concept of this investigation is based on phenomenon of interaction between deuterium and hydrogen ions, on one hand, and the solid medium (of Pd, Ti and other materials), on the other hand. The said interaction was studied in experiments with electrolysis, electric gas discharge and gas diffusion. At present a huge collection of stable 100%-reproduced results on Excess Heat power production has been accumulated. In most experiments the correlation of the relative output Excess Heat power to the input (electric) power does not exceed 10-20%. This scientific approach is now well recognized by the leading groups of researchers and scientific associations (such as the American Physical Society, the American Nuclear Society, the Los Alamos US National Laboratory, the US Livermore Lawrence National Laboratory and others.) despite the lack of widely familiar theoretical instrument for the description of the physical phenomena in question.",

This is potentially a very important source of energy because the techniques shown here, can increase the excess energy gain of CF/LANR reactions by at least 410%. In addition, by monitoring both the calorimetry and the Voc, detailed knowledge of the deuteron distribution and flows within the palladium are revealed. These experiments revealed that initially only one in 2300 deuterons takes part in the desired reactions of HAD excess enthalpy production, for a net utilization of 0.04% of the loaded deuterons at that time. This decreases over time. Integrated over the entire HAD regime, this deuteron participation levels falls, and eventually only 1 in 106 deuterons participates in the desired fusion reactions.",

In January 1990, we improved our sample preparation procedure and our detector sensitivity level so that the neutron-emission measurements are now reproducible, but not yet predictable. We have measured excess neutron emission from the majority of our most recent samples using our high-sensitivity neutron detectors. The improved sensitivity in our new detector system was obtained by using low-radioactive-background stainless steel tubes, a small detector volume with high efficiency, and additional cosmic-ray shielding. Our most sensitive detector consists of two independent segments making up inner and outer rings of 3He tubes. The combined total efficiency is 44%. In addition to inner and outer ring segments, we have three separate detector systems operating in parallel control experiments to monitor environmental change. We have measured neutron bursts from a variety of samples containing Ti metal and D2  gas. The low-multiplicity bursts, emitting from 2 to 10 n, occur much more frequently than the higher multiplicity bursts. By measuring high-mass samples (300 g Ti) over several weeks, with many liquid nitrogen temperature cycles, we have detected neutron emission above the background from most of the samples with a significance level of 3 to 9 \u03c3.",

Results concerning the reproducibility of the phenomena, theoretical studies and certain unknown nuclear effects in metal-hydrogen systems have been published by several authors. It has been shown that positive ions (i.e. deuterons) confined by means of a quadrupolar electro-dynamic containment around palladium lattice tetrahedral sites (lattice ion trap) can dramatically decrease their mean distance. In the proposed picture the coherent oscillations of the Fermi level electrons of the metal atoms seem to have a dominant role in the deuterons dynamics.In this work the dynamics of the particles is studied in the trap coordinate system, rather than in the particles relative ones, since in this way it is possible to follow the position of a moving particle (e.g. deuteron or proton) inside the metal lattice cell. The lattice e.m. signal has been described as an oscillating dipole one.Such a description allows us also to study the behaviour of the moving particles when their trajectory is close to the metal lattice atoms.The calculations confinn the collision mechanism and show an interaction effect between the moving particles and the metal lattice atoms.",

These small clusters, called spherons, are usually helions (i.e. a-particles), tritons and dineutrons.

The deuterium, and over one atmosphere pressure, was circulated in a sealed loop containing the cell and an ionization chamber to measure the tritium increase as a function of time. After 4800 hours of data, spanning 10 cells (including deuterium and hydrogen controls), were collected with this system. Average tritium production has varied from 0.02 to 0.2 nCi/h. Due to experimental constraints we have not been able to measure neutron output with these cells while simultaneously measuring the tritium increase. The question of tritium contamination in the palladium has been primarily resolved by the development of techniques that allow the palladium powder or foil to be reused. Various methods for increasing the tritium production, such as, increased current density, surface modifiers, and higher deuterium loading, will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "We have suggested that the mantle 3He and 3H might have originated from natural nuclear fusion (d-d and d-p reaction, or other reactions) in deep Earth. Encouraged by this new idea, we tried to recreate nuclear fusion at low temperature in the laboratory. This paper describes charged particles emitted from the deuterium-loaded titanium foil and powder at low temperature. Although the counts are very low (about 0.13 counts/h), fortunately, broad and narrow peaks are observed for the deuterium-loaded titanium foil and TiD-Mo sample respectively. The charged particle is identified as proton having energy of about 2.8 MeV after exiting the sample. We suggest that the proton might originate from d\u2011d reaction in the samples. Then the d-d reaction rate is calculated to be 1.4 ? 10^-24 fusion/d-d?sec for the deuterium-loaded titanium foil sample. On the other hand, no charged particles were observed above the background level for deuterium-loaded titanium powder sample. Therefore, this work provides a positive result of nuclear fusion for the metal foil samples, but a negative result for the powder samples. The negative result of the deuterium-loaded titanium powder sample suggests that the reaction yield might be correlated with deuterium density, or it may be correlated with microscopic variations in the deuterium-loaded titanium materials. The negative result also indicates that d-d reaction catalyzed by ?-meson from cosmic ray can be excluded in this experiment. The present work may be helpful to the further study on the physical mechanism of nuclear fusion in deuterium (hydrogen)-loaded metals and also helpful to the study of origin of 3He in the deep Earth.",

A statistical analysis is presented of the results of 176 experiments intended to test the means of establishing reproducible control over D/Pd loading. A set of variables are examined, and procedures identified which permit the attainment of loading above the threshold necessary for excess heat production.Calorimetric results from two experiments are presented and analyzed. A mathematical function is identified which correlates closely with the time evolution of excess power. An important element of this correlation is the measured rate of change of the cathode resistivity.

Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons had claimed that an electrochemical cell with heavy water electrolyte and a palladium cathode put out so much excess energy that the mysterious phenomenon had to be nuclear, and was probably a process related to nuclear fusion. Newspapers and magazines said it might be a major scientific discovery with the potential to end the energy crisis and revolutionize society. For a few heady weeks the public took it seriously and waited anxiously for laboratories to replicate the results. Many scientists quickly took sides for or against cold fusion - mostly against. Then, by the end of the summer of 1989 the official word came, in an authoritative report written by a select panel of experts under the auspices of the Department of Energy: cold fusion was a bust. It did not exist. It was an experimental error. It could not be reproduced. Nearly every scientific journal, magazine and newspaper on earth reported this, and cold fusion abruptly dropped out of the headlines. The story, it seemed, was over. Actually, it had barely begun. Only a few thousand electrochemists in the world were qualified to do the experiments, and most of them were too busy or not interested in trying. In that autumn as public interest faded and the U.S. Department of Energy pronounced a death sentence, a small number of experienced scientists prepared serious, full-scale experiments.

These studies had the unsatisfactory feature of low signal-to-noise, but the satisfactory features of reasonable statistics and excellent correlation. An interesting feature was that x-ray emission decreased somewhat after a cell was switched off, but then spiked upward to decay exponentially to the background level over a period of days. This emission was apparently associated with the desorption of hydrogen from the cathode. With the cell turned off it was also possible to study xray emission accompanying the thermal desorption of hydrogen by changing the cell temperature and studying x-ray emission as a function of cathode surface temperature. When this effect of x-rays accompanying desorption was factored in, Bush's TRM Model appears to account for the correlation between x-ray emission and excess power.",

Ruthenium (III) nitrosylnitrate, Ru(NO)(NO3)3, was investigated in the NH4Cl + NH4OH/H2O and ND4Cl + ND4OD/D2O electrolytes. The ruthenium solution had an intense red color that remained unchanged during extensive electrolysis at constant  currents of 6, 10, 20 and 100 mA. However, at a constant current of 400 mA, the solution became completely clear overnight with a black deposit of ruthenium metal covering the copper cathode. The collapsed cyclic voltammetric trace indicated a large electrode capacitance (1?2 F) and a large ruthenium surface area (105 cm2) similar to the previous observations for palladium co-deposition in this ammonia system. Extensive calorimetric studies using a constant current of 200 or 300 mA produced no measureable excess power in H2O or D2O for this ruthenium system. The very stable calorimetry allowed the determination of the effect of the electrolyte level on the cell constant at 0.0008 W/K mL for both the Ru/H2O and the Ru/D2O systems. The mean cell constants were 0.1318 ? 0.0025 W/K for the Ru/H2O study and 0.1312 ? 0.0025 W/K for the Ru/D2O experiment. There was no chemical excess power or shuttle reactions due to the nitrate ions present in these ruthenium solutions. In contrast to the palladium co-deposition studies, there was no detection of chlorine or nitrogen trichloride formation in any ruthenium co-deposition study. Based on out-gassing observations when the current was turned off, there was no absorption of hydrogen or deuterium within the bulk of the deposited ruthenium metal. Preliminary results are also reported for co-deposition studies of rhenium (Re), iridium (Ir), and nickel (Ni). Based on these new experiments with various metals, both palladium and D2O are essential for excess power in co-deposition studies.",

In the work, the process of direct, controlled decontamination of highly active intermediate lifetime and long-lived reactor isotopes through the process of growing microbiological associations has been studied.

    "abstract": "Excess heat in the Fleischmann?Pons experiment is thought to have a nuclear origin, yet there are no energetic particles observed in amounts commensurate with the energy produced. This in our view is the most fundamental issue in connection with theory. In earlier work we developed a mathematical model (the lossy spin?boson model) which shows coherent energy exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions of fractionation. Recently, we have found an interesting physical model that is closely connected, and which is capable of coherent energy exchange with fractionation; this model is based on a relativistic description of composite nuclei in a lattice. In this work we present a much stronger development of the model directly from ?eld theory than given previously. In the lossy spin?boson model, the ability of the model to fractionate a large quantum depends on the presence of suitable loss mechanisms; the same is true in the case of the new physical model. The new model predicts anomalies such as excess heat without energetic nuclear radiation, 4He production, low-level gamma emission, and collimated X-ray emission in the Karabut experiment; however, as yet we have not demonstrated agreement between theory and experiment. Last summer we concluded (erroneously) that coupling with strong static transitions might impact the fractionation power of the model on dynamic transitions, and the resulting model appeared to be in agreement with our interpretation of the experiment. Here we review this kind of model more carefully, and ?nd that no such enhancement is present. Our conclusion in the end is that the theory, model, and interpretation are \"close\" to the experimental results in the case of the Karabut experiment, but some problem remains.",

    "abstract": "The relatively low/medium proton/carbon collision threshold energy (1?8 keV) of the Bethe?Weizs?cker nuclear reaction cycle C, N, and O observed in low temperature carbon rich stars suggests the eventual technical feasibility of a solid-state carbon fusion reactor. H+ used as a precursor nuclear material can be implanted in solid-state carbon material. We must then consider all effects that can affect nuclear collision efficiency, including solid-state structure specificity, proton channeling and the reduction of the original proton energy with electronic interactions, before looking at the possible nuclear reactions themselves. We then have to consider the different effects and types of atomic rearrangement favoring either sp2 or sp3 sites or which influence the carbon material structure. For this purpose, we review first a recently developed theoretical approach, which might explain important aspects of this phenomenon with still high confidence up to now. These aspects include quantum electronic activation especially with H2 recombination energy release, which is different from usual chemical and metallurgical thermal atomic rearrangement with which an optimized ta-C sp3 carbon structure can be controlled. It should also be considered that carbon structure determination methodology ? including the recently revised Raman theory ? provide more correct and accurate results. To be falsified a study of this type of proton?carbon nuclear reactor must also take into account effects which modify the carbon nucleus structure in favor of nuclear fusion. It is suggested that anharmonic synchronic phonon?nuclear resonance may be a contributing factor. However, present failures and the limits of abstract Quantum Mechanical formalism bring little clarification on this last point, which we suggest is owing to insufficient physical description of particle wave character. In order to improve these aspects of the theory, we suggest revisiting aether theory which with further investigation and development of 3D fluid mechanics is expected to account for all QM acquired, and to be able to provide clearer physical insight into the subatomic particle wave aspects and corresponding nuclear reaction mechanism.",

When the all deuterons become mobile, the fusion rate observed by Jones et al. can be achieved using the classical formula for the ion polarization function, however, the rate using the quantum mechanical formula becomes 10-6-10 -7 times smaller than the classical one. By the small increase in deuteron energy, of the order of a few electron volts, the fusion rate in PdDx deuteride increases substantially. But after about 10 eV of deuteron energy, the fusion rate does not increase at such a high rate as it does in the low-energy region.

ThisMWplasmoid had unusual physical properties close to those of natural ball lightning. We studied the physical parameters and properties of a longitudinal heterogeneous plasmoid (plasma formation with erosive nano-clusters) created by capacity coupled high-frequency (HF) discharge in high-speed swirl flow in our previous papers. These nano-clusters were created by an electrode?s erosion in a plasma reactor. Measurement of the power balance of this heterogeneous plasmoid is very important for aluminium?hydrogen power energetics, using a new plasma generator with high coefficient of performance (COP). This work is a continuation of our previous work. We determined that there is extra power released in heterogeneous plasmoids created by combined discharge (HF discharge + DC discharge). The measured COP in this plasmoid is about 2?10. We suppose that this extra power release in a heterogeneous plasmoid is connected with LENR. The obtained experimental results (COP, optical spectra, soft X-ray spectra, chemical composition of dusty particles) prove our suggestion. It was revealed that a heterogeneous non-equilibrium plasmoid creates intensive soft X-ray radiation (with quantum energy about 1?10 keV). We determined that excited and charged cluster particles are responsible for this soft X-ray radiation creation, to be exact. Parameters of heterogeneous non-equilibrium plasmoid (Ne, Te, TV, TR and others) were measured in the experimental plasma vortex reactor (PVR). The main goals of this work are the following: (1) Creation of plasma-chemical vortex reactor (PVR) with high COP.

    "abstract": "While experimental and technological attention is focused on the operational methods for hydrogen loading in metals and on the observed anomalies with respect to well-established rules, we aim to remark that these methods and these consequences can be seen as a part of a more general problem. In fact, most of the experiments and deductions of material sciences are based on the assumption that space?time is flat and isotropic (Minkowskian). After discarding this assumption, a theory of Deformed Space Time (DST) was developed in the last decades. Following this theory, experimental results were obtained which are not predicted by the Standard Model. The DST-theory concerns the fundamental interactions and in particular the nuclear ones, that can play the main role in the observed anomalies. In order to consider a nuclear reaction as a DST-reaction, four main phenomenological features were deduced: occurrence of an energy threshold; change of atomic weight; absence of gamma radiation; anisotropic emission of nuclear particles in intense beams having a very short life span. From the experimental point of view, rather than looking for fortuitous events that produce the conditions for DST-reactions, more systematic research can be undertaken by following the above reported four general rules. In particular, the occurrence of thresholds can correspond to a latency time, required to reach the energy density necessary to deform space?time. The absence of gamma radiation cannot be considered as a sign that nuclear reactions are not present; in fact, in absence of detected gamma radiation, elements were found which were not present before the reaction. The nuclear emissions, which are anisotropic and impulsive, can be difficult to detect with the traditional methods, thus inducing incertitude on the occurring reactions. Finally, a rapid variation of energy density is an experimental common factor of DST-reactions. Thus, the DST-theory can be the leading theory in the design of the experiment and in the interpretation of its experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is cited from the research literature on metals containing absorbed deuterium supporting the hypothesis that the excess heat episodes observed over the past 25 years are the result of exothermic deuteron stripping reactions with atomic nuclei of the absorbing metal. The deuteron stripping reaction is one in which the neutron half of the mass 2 deuteron is captured by an atomic nucleus while the proton half of the deuteron is ejected, repelled by the coulomb field of the positively charged metal nucleus. This hypothesis provides a plausible explanation why so little external radiation accompanies the episodes of excess heat first observed by Fleischmann and Pons [1]. The reaction products from stable isotopes of the host metal are a proton with energies up to 9.2 MeV energy and a recoiling nucleus with energies of \u0018100?to 600 keV. These two reaction products are retained near their birthplace because their range in solids is less than \u0018100 \u0016m. The emitted proton is energetic enough to produce by (p,n), (p, ), (p,T), and (p,X-ray), reactions with host metal nuclei and their light-element impurities, the small number of neutrons, alpha particles, tritium atoms (T), and X-rays, occasionally observed associated with deuterated Ti and Pd. The PIXE process (proton induced X-ray emission) is expected in which numerous K, L, and M X-rays of the absorbing metal are produced. For metals with thicknesses of >1 mm the vast majority of such X-rays do not escape the metal. In experiments with foils of the host metal sufficiently thin, low levels of charged particles (mostly protons) have been observed. Some of the observed protons were at energies larger than 3.0 MeV, the largest possible energy of protons from the fusion of two deuterons. Widely observed He4 and tritium are known products of the deuteron stripping reaction with Li6, which is a major constituent of electrolytes and a minor impurity in most metals. In any case, researchers have observed small but definite indicators of nuclear reactions other than d+d fusion in deuterated metals at temperatures not significantly above ambient.",

In order to eliminate the influence of oxidized Pd particles on the absorption capacity, measurements were repeated three or four times without exposing the samples to air. For both nano-Pd materials, the absorption capacity at 1MPa was found to be slightly smaller than that of Pd bulk. The difference in the absorption capacity between hydrogen and deuterium, i.e., the isotope effect, was negligible within the experimental error. It was found that the average size of the Pd particles was significantly increased after the repeated measurements of the absorption capacity. The heat generated upon pressurizing the materials with deuterium or hydrogen up to 1MPa was measured using a flow calorimeter. Similar to the measurements of absorption capacity, the heat measurements were also conducted repeatedly. The observed heat generation was composed of two stages, i.e., the first stage during pressurizing the samples from 0 to 1 MPa and the second stage, where the sample was kept under a fixed pressure of 1 MPa. The heat generated in the first stage was much larger at the time of the first measurement than at the second or third. The heat generated in the first stage was largely explained by taking into account two chemical reactions, i.e., the water formation reaction and the deuteride formation reaction. It was noted that in the second stage, where the heat generated from chemical reactions was hardly expected to occur, a small heat power was observed intermittently. This heat evolution was observed frequently when the samples were loaded with deuterium.",

The resulting screening energy values are about one order of magnitude larger compared to gas target experiments and exceed significantly the theoretical predictions. A thorough investigation of the processes in the targets under ion irradiation shows that there are multi-parameter collateral effects which are crucial for the correct interpretation of the observed enhancements. They mainly originate from target surface contaminations due to residual gases in the vacuum as well as from inhomogeneities in the deuteron density distribution in heterogeneous targets. For the special situation of deuterium in the metallic environment an improved analysis method has been developed beyond the standard procedures. Experimental evidence for the influence of such effects and a mathematical model for their assessment are given and compared with the results of other groups.

Acceptance of these levels and, in particular, experimental evidence of their existence would have major implications for the basis for cold fusion and would open up new fields of femto-physics and -chemistry. An introduction shows some general considerations on these orbits as \"anomalous\" (and usually rejected) solutions of relativistic quantum equations. The first part of our study is devoted to a discussion of the arguments against the deep orbits and for them, as exemplified in published solutions. We examine each of the principal negative arguments found in the literature and show how it is possible to resolve the questions raised. In fact, most of the problems are related to the singularity of the Coulomb potential when considering the nucleus as a point charge, and so they can be easily resolved when considering a more realistic potential with finite value inside the nucleus. In a second part, we consider specific works on deep orbits, named Dirac Deep Levels (DDLs), as solutions of the relativistic Schr?dinger and of the Dirac equations. The latter presents the most complete solution and development for spin 1/2 particles, and includes an infinite family of DDL solutions. We examine particularities of these DDL solutions and more generally of the anomalous solutions. Next, we analyze the methods for, and the properties of, the solutions that include a corrected potential inside the nucleus, and we examine the questions raised by this new element. Finally, we indicate, in the conclusion, open questions such as the physical meaning of the relation between quantum numbers determining the deep levels and the fact that the angular momentum seems two orders-of-magnitude lower than the values associated with the Planck constant.",

As this process does not measurably disrupt the palladium lattice the system provides an excellent approximation to a lattice gas. The Monte Carlo method of predicting the behaviour of the lattice gas model for particular values of the D-D interactions is described and it is shown that for repulsive first nearest-neighbour (V1) and second nearest-neighbour (V2) interactions with V2=0.25 V1, the Monte Carlo method gives similar results to those obtained by a cluster variation method calculation. However, the latter method only predicts the transition temperature accurately near stoichiometric compositions. The above choice of interactions also gives a good description of the real system for D concentrations between 64 and 68% and it is suggested how agreement at higher concentrations could be achieved by introducing longer range interactions. A method of estimating the values of Vn from diffuse neutron scattering above the transition temperature is also proposed.",

An analysis of a general class of two-step coherent reactions involving charged nucleons has been performed, and very small reaction rates are found. This result is due to the small tunneling factors associated with coulomb repulsion.We are investigating two-step coherent reactions which begin through weak interaction mediated electron capture, which in hydrogen isotopes would produce off-shell (virtual) neutrons. No coulomb repulsion occurs for virtual neutrons. Virtual neutron capture by deuterons would yield tritium, and virtual neutron capture by protons would yield deuterons; the latter process is favored by a factor of 104 in the square of the matrix element on a per nucleon basis, and corresponds to a heat-producing reaction. The nuclear reaction energy would be coupled into the electrolysis process, with the final reaction products stationary.We have found that the weak interaction process can in principle be superradiant in the Dicke sense. If so, then considerable acceleration of this type of coherent reaction may occur.",

When including the magnetic interactions near the nucleus, we observed a breakthrough in how to satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation (HUR) for electrons confined near the nucleus, in a radial zone of only a few fm. Here we chose a different method, by directly facing the HUR for such confined electrons, from which we deduce the coefficient ? of these highly relativistic electrons.

After approximately 6500 h of counting time, we have obtained no evidence for cold fusion processes leading to neutron production. However, we have observed all three types of neutron data that have been presented as evidence for cold fusion: large positive fluctuations in the neutron counting rate, weak peaks near 2.5 MeV in the neutron energy spectrum, and bursts of up to 145 neutrons in 500-{mu}s intervals. The data were obtained under circumstances that clearly show our results to be data encountered as a part of naturally occurring neutron background, which is due primarily to cosmic rays. Thus, observing these types of data does not, of itself, provide evidence for the existence of cold fusion processes. Artifacts in the data that were due to counter misbehavior were also to lead to long-term neutron bursts'' whose time duration varied from several hours to several days.

We have developed a new theoretical description that places delocalized lattice phonon degrees of freedom on the same footing as local residual position operators. With this formulation, we have found that a lattice vibrational mode cannot accept a large energy quantum, as the coupling is not sufficiently nonlinear. We propose a new set of second order reactions in which a local exothermic reaction couples off-resonance to a highly excited phonon mode at low order, and the phonon mode dissipates the large energy quantum through low order coupling to endothermic channels.",

In that case one is led to predict a) the existence of new \"tight\" quantum molecular states (associated to new \"tight\" Bohr orbits) which correspond to the emission of X--ray lines and excess energy b) the associated apparition of a certain amount of nuclear fusion reactions due to those magnetic interactions and enhanced tunneling by strong electron concentrations. They appear in the form of neutron (or ?) bursts and various types of \"ashes\" of particular nuclear fusion reactions in electrolysis, glow discharge, capillary devices, resonance sonoluminescence and plasma discharge experiments. They both contribute to observable energy excess in amounts which vary which chosen set-ups.To explore this assumption two experiments are presented here i.e. 1) discharge experiments in plasma focus and \"capillary fusion\" devices (i.e. nuclear fusion) of 10^8 neutrons/burst 2) X-ray measurements in deuterium plasma focus which confirm the existence of new Bohr orbits.New possible experiments to check it are also briefly discussed.",

These measurements clearly show the anomalous increase in the cell temperature despite the steadily decreasing electrical input power during Pd/D2O+LiOD/Pt electrolysis. This strange behavior can be modeled by the use of an anomalous excess power term in the calorimetric equations. Two thermistors used in each calorimetric cell always show nearly identical temperature changes, thus errors due to temperature gradients within the cell are unlikely. The onset of the excess power apparently develops in a gradual manner. There were never any large, abrupt increases in the excess power. The addition of D2O with its sudden cooling of the cell generally dissipated the excess power effect. No clear triggering events for the excess power could be identified. Possible chemical explanations for the excess power are discussed. Normal behavior was always observed for a similar experiment conducted as a control.",

    "abstract": "The phase diagram of PdHX was first understood with the development of statistical mechanics models in the 1930s, where hydrogen atoms were modeled as occupying octahedral sites with an O-site energy that depended on the loading. In an earlier study we made use of a generalization of this kind of model to include both O-site and T-site occupation to model loading in the alpha phase, loading in the beta phase, and to develop a mean field model for the phase diagram of PdHX. Here we extend the modeling to develop a model phase diagram for PdDX. Since the PdDX phase diagram is less studied that the PdHx phase diagram, the selection of isotherms is an issue, and we encountered minor technical issues in the digitization of published isotherm data. It was possible to develop good extrapolations to low loading (required for our phase diagram optimization), but we found that a reliable extrapolation of isotherms at high temperature to high loading was not possible. Consequently, after some exploration we found that \"reasonable\" global phase diagram models could be obtained with the introduction of a \"guiding\" point, where we introduce an estimate for a single pressure at high temperature and high loading to constrain the O-site energies and resulting phase diagram. This underscores the need for experimental measurements in this regime in order to understand the phase diagram. We were successful in optimizing a mean field phase diagram model for PdDX using this approach. We made use of the isotherms from our earlier modeling for PdHX to develop a new phase diagram model for PdHX making use of the same basic approach. The resulting O-site energy curves are qualitatively similar, with a somewhat deeper binding for H at high loading (attributed to the increased lattice expansion), and larger spread in O-site energies as a function of temperature (attributed to the reduced number of configurations accessible at low energy due to the larger excitation energy of the lower mass hydrogen atom).",

The combined electron and neutrino EOM?s support temporary neutrino-electron binding and discover the mass and length scales of a nucleon on an ab initio basis. It is believed that the bound pair is a form of W boson, symbolized here by W? s for binding of a neutrino to a positron or electron (?) and for spin (s) equal to 0 or 1. It is also believed that W?s bosons may be useful as building blocks in constructing models in the LENR regime which may be physically equivalent to quarks and the known W? boson in the high-energy regime.",

    "abstract": "Tritium up to fifty times background has been observed upon electrolyzing 1N D2 SO4 in four out of four cells when using Pd cathodes \"of a certain type\". No tritium was detected in four control cells, containing H2S04 in H2O, employing Pd cathodes cut from the same wire spool. Tritium amounts were from 7 x 10^10 to 2.1 ? 10^11 atoms, corresponding to average generation rates from 5.1 ? 10^4 to 2 ? 10^5 atoms/sec/cm^2. In all cases, D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ? 0.05 were attained. A cyclic loading/unloading regime rather than the usual continuous constant current regime was applied to attain these high loadings. Tritium analysis was performed in Pd, electrolyte and the gas head space of the sealed cells. Maximum tritium concentrations of 8.9 ? 10^10 atoms/g Pd, 180 times the detection limit, were found in the D-loaded Pd cathodes, none in the \u0397-loaded Pd, Also, no tritium within detection limit was found in 150 unused Pd pieces. Of these, 13 were cut randomly from the same wire spool as the four D-loaded Pd cathodes. The probability that the tritium in the latter was due to random spot contamination is computed as 1 in 2,380. It is concluded that the tritium was generated by nuclear reactions in the Pd. However, no tritium was detected in four D-loaded Pd cathodes of a different type in spite of attaining loadings D/Pd = 1.

At places of electron currents, the electric potential becomes negative and there relevant nuclei gather and collide. Then, if electrons exist in close vicinities in addition, there the electric potential barriers are lowered further and the tunneling effects which bring about nuclear fusions drastically increase. Resultantly, the rate of nuclear fusions enhances as a whole. Then, if shape of the current can be sufficiently fine and strong the increase is more drastic.

Our application of these mainstream ideas is inconsistent with the predominant paradigm that is commonly applied to Cold Fusion because it uses important ideas that relate periodic order to coherence that are known to apply at low temperature (LT) in solids and to hydrogen-in-metal systems that are not consistent with the conventional high temperature (HT) models that have formed the basis of conventional thinking. Implicit in this alternative (LT) picture is the important result that symmetry provides a means of \"hiding\" the potential location of a particular nuclear reaction.

Some reflections to Rutherford?s discovery of nuclear physics, the Cockroft-Oliphant discovery of anomalous low energy fusion reactions and the chemist Hahn?s discovery of fission had to be included. Using gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant results were seen e.g. from the \"life after death\" heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect - preferably in the swimming electron layer - may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U of about megaseconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the appearance of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-megasecond reactions of cold fusion.

We found the results previously published to be consistent with our observations; namely we measured higher temperatures for the same input power when hydrogen is absorbed during a heating cycle. Nevertheless this temperature rise does not appear to correspond to an increase in heat production. We have added a temperature sensor to the container of the experiment. The temperature of the container follows the same temperature with input power curve irrespective of whether there is an anomalous absorption of hydrogen or not; therefore we have no evidence that this temperature increase corresponds to another source of heat. In conclusion, we have observed all the effects discovered by Focardi et al., but our results imply that there is no production of power associated with the absorption of hydrogen by nickel",

    "abstract": "Palladium-silver cathodic membranes are used in industrial tritiated water processing to produce very high purity tritium gas and its isotopes. During electrolysis, these adsorb on the cathodic surface, diffuse through the alloy, and finally are desorbed on the side opposite of the cathodic entry surface. This desorption occurs in a gastight compartment separated from the electrolyzer allowing the recuperation of pure isotopes. The diffusion is dependent on cathodic surface, PdAg thickness, temperature, deposits on the surface to favor the adsorption, and applied cathodic potential. Here, the embrittlement of palladium and PdAg alloy cathode membranes and the diffusion and solubility parameters were studied in tritiated water. Voltammetry curves were plotted to ascertain the conditions of cathodic charging with tritium as well as the effect of radiolytic hydrogen peroxide on palladium or PdAg. From the voltammetric curves, the diffusion coefficient, the surface solubility of tritium, and the thickness of the palladium and PdAg alloy involved were determined. Scanning electron microscope examinations show that the cracking is transgranular in the case of palladium, while it appears to be intergranular for the PdAg allow. With palladium, this cracking involves all the surface subjected to charging, whereas for the alloy, only the surface at the electrolyzer gas atmosphere/electrolyte bordering zone would appear to be embrittled. This could be the result of the presence of two tritiated phases in palladium or in palladium-silver. The PdAg alloy is the less sensitive to embrittlement. 18 refs., 15 figs.",

    "abstract": "The field of condensed matter nuclear science originated in 1989 with Fleischmann and Pons? electrolysis of Pd with heavy water. However, anomalous heat generation and other related phenomena were observed not only by electrochemical methods, but also by loading of deuterium or hydrogen in metals such as Pd and Ni. In this paper, we will first give a short overview of the progress in these gas loading type experiments. After that, we will describe the recent progress of our research team. The authors have been studying energy generation using nano-sized multilayer metal composites with hydrogen gas. Two nano-sized metal multilayer composite samples, which were composed of Ni, Cu, and other thin films on bulk Ni (25 mm ? 25 mm ? 0.1 mm), were used. These samples were fabricated by the Ar ion beam method, or by the magnetron sputtering method. Heat bursts and excess energy generation were observed during the experiments under vacuum conditions (<10^-4 Pa) using nano-sized metal multilayer composites on Ni substrate and hydrogen gas. Released energy normalized to the total amount of absorbed hydrogen reached 16 keV/H or 1.5 GJ/H-mol. Sometimes spontaneous heat bursts were observed. This suggests that the burst heat release reactions occurred in the near surface region of the nano-sized multilayer metal composite. Furthermore, we have succeeded in intentionally inducing heat bursts, based on the observations of the spontaneous heat bursts. By measuring the optical spectrum emitted from the sample, we detected a simultaneous increase in mid infrared radiation flux when a heat burst occurred.",

    "abstract": "Excess heat in the Fleischmann?Pons experiment occurs without commensurate energetic nuclear radiation, which motivated us to seek mechanisms capable of fractionating a large quantum, resulting in the lossy spin-boson model. Collimated x-ray emission in the Karabut experiment we interpreted as demonstrating the conversion of vibrational energy to nuclear excitation, as predicted from the lossy spin-boson model; this motivated us to seek physical models that could account for the effect. We found that the coupling strength associated with electron?nuclear and electron?electron coupling was too weak to fractionate keV quanta into 100 MHz vibrations, which motivated us to seek a theory in which nuclear transitions coupled directly to vibrations. These considerations led us to a lattice model with a relativistic description of compound nuclei, in which a strong phonon-nuclear interaction is present. This interaction is normally rotated out with the Foldy?Wouthuysen transformation, but in the presence of strong loss mechanismsthis transformation becomes unhelpful. The model that results describes the coupling of vibrational energy to nuclear excitation, but earlier efforts to apply it to the Karabut experiment resulted in inconsistencies. This motivated us to analyze fluctuations due to electron-phonon coupling in metals, which we find here to be a weak effect for Bloch picture phonon exchange, and a somewhat stronger effect with Born?Oppenheimer phonon exchange. As no new physics were found to substantially enhance fractionation, we returned to the basic theory, and carried out a systematic analysis of the three different degrees of freedom that result from simple product approximations for the wavefunction. We find that when there are more virtual phonons than real, a significant enhancement of the coupling strength occurs, corresponding to a new anomalous regime. Conditions on the coupling matrix element and relative state occupation are derived for the anomalous regime, which favors strongly-coupled low energy transitions which constitute a largefraction of all nuclei present. The fractionation power of a sample in the anomalous regime is very much constrained, which allows us to be able to make predictions with the new model. We find that the 30.77 keV transition in 93Nb is likely to be in the anomalous regime in a Nb cathode; that the threshold fractionation energy is too low for excitation of the 30.77 keV transition; but that the threshold fractionation energy is high enough to result in the excitation of the 1565 eV transition in 201Hg, and x-ray emission in the few keV regime consistent with Karabut?s observations.",

There found a very specific phenomenon of intense charge and discharge of deuterium in the Pd cathode during the continuous electrolysis of heavy water, and this was termed 'on-off effect'. While the Pd was strongly absorbing and exhausting deuterium, the thermal behavior of the Pd was examined in detail, and it was concluded that its feature and the generation of huge innerpressure of the Pd should be a necessary condition for the achievement of 'cold' fusion reaction. It was clarified that a large amount of excess heat produced during the electrolysis was not due to 'unobserved nuclear fusion' proposed by Fleischmann and Pons, but due to 'reaction heat' which connected with intense absorption and explosive exhaust of the deuterium into and out of the Pd.

This amount of excess enthalpy is difficult to explain by any chemical reaction. Numerous experiments have shown that there is no recombination of the D2  and O2 electrolysis gases when fully-submerged palladium cathodes are used. Recombination can occur when palladium particles are exposed to the gas phase. In this case, our experiments prove that this recombination can be readily detected and easily corrected.

Experimental evidence indicates that low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) occur on or very near to the surfaces of solid lattices. The rates of such reactions depend on the total area of the lattices in an LENR experiment, the fraction of that area which is active and the number of reactions per area per second. The powers further depend on the energy per reaction. The production rates of materials are related to the masses of the reaction products. And, the fluxes of radiations depend on the fraction of the reactions that produce energetic quanta. These factors are examined in this paper. A simple, but useful graphical method to relate surface areas to output nuclear powers is presented. It is used to make the first estimate of the active fraction of a surface in LENR experiments. Optimization of power outputs from LENR experiments is discussed in relation to the various factors cited above and to past work. The several intersections between LENR and both nano-science and nanotechnology are examined. A new engineering discipline will be required to turn the current science of LENR into practical sources of energy, materials and maybe radiations.",

His reputation grew at a time (1950-1960) when electrochemistry was a popular subject for university research. British Electricity saw their chance to get a star performer down to Southampton University as professor, so they paid for a chair for a person who could attract research support and found that F could fill the job, although it was open to other candidates. Fleischmann occupied the chair for only a few years, less than had been foreseen, and retired from university life some years before it is usual. By this time he already was a Fellow of the Royal Society and also a director of the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. Fleischmann made a colleague of Stanley Pons, head of the Chemistry Department in the University in Utah. Pons (P) was of independent means and could fund research which the two of them might think out together. Fusion means coming together and F saw in electrochemistry a high performance way whereby this might be done. What they found was that the heat evolved in a particular deuterium solution when they passed current through it was larger than it should have been according to known chemical theory. In addition to this they observed some neutrons. They suggested that the extra heat was due to an unknown nuclear reaction. What was unusual about the next step was that F&P got on the McNeil-Lehrer Hour and announced that they had been the first to carry out a nuclear reaction in the cold. After a short time, the nuclear chemists of the world turned against F&P and said that their claims must be all nonsense. The anti-Fleischmann opinion expressed at meetings was so great that they decided that it would be a good thing to escape to some other country. They had a friendship with a very wealthy man, Mr. Toyota, and he had already founded some laboratories in the South of France. He offered F and P laboratory space there and they could move their operation to it free of the negative atmosphere which reigned in America. At first the news which came from the laboratory in France was good. Alas, this was not maintained and after two years they split up and P retired to live in France whilst F retired to Tisbury in the U.K. But F?s creativity would not lie down and he was soon to apply something new, Quantum Electrodynamics. He made a colleagueship with a well-known Italian physicist Preparata. However, fate was not kind to F and he discovered that he was suffering from Parkinson?s disease. This is a slow disease but it?s incurable. However, for a couple of years F continued to attend meetings and make intelligent remarks at them. He died on 3 August 2012. Was F a brilliant theorist who did not have time to realize his true vision or had Jack the Flash, his nickname, flashed too much?

    "abstract": "Abstract The effective interaction potential for charged particles is calculated in the deuterium plasma formed in the surface region of the palladium cathode in the electrolysis of heavy water. It is shown that the Coulomb potential is overscreened producing, at certain distances, an attractive potential between deuterium nuclei pairs and also between the deuterium nuclei and the surface atoms. This behavior of the effective potential in the deuterium plasma can be regarded as a counterpart of the Friedel oscillations of the electron gas at zero temperature. Because of this attractive potential, there are bound states for the deuteron pairs as well as for the surface atoms and deuterons. In these bound states the equilibrium distance between the nuclei is of the order 0.15 - 0.2 ? depending on the number density of deuterons. The fusion rate is calculated for the bounded deuteron pairs and it is found to be of the order?? per deuteron pair for the highest deuteron densities. Furthermore, it is shown that larger fusion rates are possible for the deuterons bound to the surface atoms. This may arise by a process, where the trapped deuterons share the released energy collectively via a proposed Multiple Resonance Scattering (MRS) mechanism. It is then found that the 4He-channel is the overwhelmingly dominant fusion channel. Moreover, the appearance of the transmutation processes in this MRS procedure are briefly discussed.",

This paper provides a brief tutorial on basic issues, including the Carnot limit, entropy, and thermoelectric conversion. Practical thermal to electric conversion is possible well below the Carnot limit, and this leads to a high threshold for self-sustaining operation in Pons-Fleischmann type experiments. Excess power production at elevated temperatures will become increasingly important as we move toward self-sustaining devices and energy production for applications. Excess power production in heatproducing systems that do not require electrical input have an enormous advantage over electrochemical systems. Such systems should be considered seriously within our community in the coming years.",

A high success ratio was also obtained using Johnson-Matthey materials. Calorimeters that are capable of detecting excess power levels of 1 watt per cubic centimeter of palladium are essential for research in this field. Results from our laboratory indicate that helium-4 is the missing nuclear product accompanying the excess heat. Thirty out of 33 experiments showed a correlation between either excess power and helium production or no excess power and no excess helium. The only valid experiments that showed significant excess power but no excess helium involved a Pd-Ce cathode. The collection and analysis of the electrolysis gases place the helium-4 production rate at lOll to 10'2 atoms per second per watt of excess power.

This enables one to determine the systematic of binding energy in a much simpler way than the approach based on individual nucleons. The author developed that idea, i.e. having clusters as basic bricks within the nucleus instead of nucleons. He considered the binding energy of a particle, deuterium, tritium, 3He, and the way these spherons are bonded instead of the bonding between individual nucleons. According to that hypothesis the nuclei of the various isotopes of each element are constituted out of a particles and other nucleons grouped in order to form sub-nuclei bound together by four types of bonds called NN, NP, NNP and NPP. So, the author favored an approach trying to breakdown the binding energy value of each element isotope in the sub-values indicated above.

Surface plasmons in metal nanoparticulates strongly interact with electromagnetic fields at their resonance, resulting in an intense focusing of the incident energy around the metal surface. It is therefore possible to take the advantage of such high energy concentration, under laser or electric power input, for instance by simply coating the conventional Pd-based fuel materials with noble-metal nanoparticles or nanoshells. This field-enhancement effect can be a powerful method to boost the fusion-triggering electromagnetic or optical energy to significantly improve the reaction rate and experimental reproducibility, and to create low-D-load fusion systems. Importantly, this enhancement scheme is applicable to both gas- and liquid-phase systems, and furthermore, not only for laser/optical power, but also for the conventional electrolysis systems due to the equivalency between light and electromagnetic fields. We also show that the conventional fusion-catalyzing metals of Pd, Ni, and Ti themselves intrinsically exhibit a certain degree of field enhancement for their nanostructured form. Therefore, we point out that this plasmonic effect may have been unknowingly produced particularly in the electrolysis-type fusion experiments reported so far. This field-enhancement phenomenon thus could be a clue to solve the mystery of the energy supplied to overcome the gigantic Coulomb barrier to produce the fusion reaction observed with visible rates, as well as a powerful tool for further technical progress.",

The experiment using the Pd-B cathode also shows excess enthalpy generation in other temperature regions as well as the very early development of \"positive feedback\" (compare (10), (11), (12)). Such \"positive feedback\" complicates the analyses of the experiments.

    "abstract": "Some reports from ICCF22 (Takahashi et al., Iwamura et al., Parkhomov et al., Mizuno et al.) show that selected materials lead to higher power at higher temperatures, probably at temperatures below 2000 K, and pressures below 10 MPa. In the early part of this report, we show the theoretical extrapolation of data described in these recent reports which indicates that low energy nuclear reaction systems at temperatures over 7000 K may release energy at a rate comparable to combustion of fossil fuels, or perhaps even higher. It is also stressed that high pressure levels of 100 MPa physically will lead to less diffusion of H2 (or D2) gas from solid materials (e.g., powder of such as palladium or nickel) that have absorbed the gas. Less diffusion leads to higher power. In the present report, we propose a new reactor which may lead to power at the level of a chemical reaction such as combustion of fossil fuels. This reactor is based on two new basic technologies. Our first technology is a new device with a power source based on focusing compression due to pulsed supermulti-jets colliding around the reaction chamber center, which will have potential of the level of 7000 K and 100 MPa in chamber as maximum, leading to high power. It should be able to continuously produce power as an open system. The high compression potential at level of 100 MPa and 7000 K was confirmed by experiments and computational simulations without chemical and nuclear reactions. Our second technology is an injector of nanoparticles such as those of palladium or nickel, which remains durable for more than 30 hours, which may lead to continuous low energy nuclear reactions. These may make it possible to construct a heat source powered by a low energy nuclear reaction in nanoparticles such as palladium or nickel, which is triggered by a chemical reaction of H2 (or D2)-oxygen mixture, where the reactor is initially brought to a high temperature and high pressure.",

    "abstract": "A composite is made up of constituent particles; the center of mass dynamics is that of a single particle, and the composite can have many internal states and degrees of freedom. The notion of a quantum composite is foundational to atomic, molecular, nuclear and particle physics; in our view it is also foundational to condensed matter nuclear science. It comes as a surprise that there do not appear to be review papers that discuss quantum composites. Here we consider elementary particles models, which are used to model composites; the most widely used example is that of the Dirac phenomenology for protons and neutrons. Quantum composite models can be developed from many-particle models, in some cases simply by rewriting in terms of center of mass and relative operators, and in other cases through a reduction or transformation. We have proposed models for anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science which rely heavily on the notion of a relativistic quantum composite. In the nonrelativistic case there is a clean separation of center of mass and internal degrees of freedom, so that any coupling between them must occur through external field interactions. The relativistic composite has a sizeable coupling between the center of mass motion and internal degrees of freedom, which we have proposed is responsible for the anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science. We have developed a newmodel in which the center of mass dynamics is modeled as nonrelativistic, but the internal structure is kept relativistic; this kind of model is much better adapted to problems in condensed matter nuclear science. Our approach has been strongly criticized, since in a Poincar? invariant theory the center of mass motion separates from the internal degrees of freedom in free space. We are able to rotate out the strongest part of this coupling in free space, consistent with Poincar? invariance. However, in the lattice the problem is in general much more complicated, and more powerful tools are required to diagonalize this relativistic coupling. The spin-boson type of models that we have considered previously for this are the simplest idealized models that can be diagonalized; they describe rich dynamics not present in the free-space version of the problem.",

It is a situation in which the validity of research in one particular field has been officially questioned, at least in the US. According to many scientists, the cold fusion claims are in conflict with basic principles of physics and chemistry. That is why most researchers are no longer interested in cold fusion. Surprisingly, however, the field still attracts a large number of investigators with excellent credentials.

Today most LENR research focuses on the former issues, while nuclear structure theory remains the same conundrum that it has been for 80 years. The essence of the problem is that there has been no self-consistent spatiotemporal description of nuclear structure ? and, as a consequence, no reliable framework within which to address the oldest and most outstanding problem in nuclear physics: the nuclear force. The unanswered question in traditional nuclear physics ? and the new challenge in LENR ? is how to reconcile the short-range nuclear force known from nucleon scattering experiments with the wealth of empirical data on nuclear structure.

As a result, energy far exceeding input was continuously obtained. In the best results obtained thus far, the output thermal energy is double the input electrical energy, amounting to several hundred watts. The generated thermal energy follows an exponential temperature function. When the reactor temperature is 300?C, the generated energy is 1 kW.

This excess energy is estimated by measured gas density and pressure behind shock wave, its propagation velocity in plasma, and by using gas dynamics conservation laws.(2) A systematic study of new chemical element creation in water by cold heterogeneous plasmoids was performed.

A series of concepts, which were raised and partly elaborated, are presented. The key concept is a three-body mechanism, where one of the nuclei serves as a catalyst for the reaction of the other two. In these reactions, a single fusion product or two outgoing nuclei are created, along with the recoiled catalytic nucleus. They carry off the nuclear energy released, and heat the surrounding materials by multiple collisions. Importantly, they produce high energy ! radiation with negligible probability. So, this three-body idea solves the two major riddles of LENR, that nuclear reactions can occur at ordinary temperatures and without emitting ! radiation. Cross sections and rates are calculated using standard quantum mechanics, and accepted nuclear and solid-state physics. Their dependence on relevant densities, and on the reacting and catalytic nuclei, are explicit. The theoretical ideas and the results of their elaboration are compared with diverse data from LENR experiments with considerable success.",

A narrow window is proposed to reach the ~10 W/cm3 required nuclear heating for three-body fusion by a hypothetical excitation-screening model. A relatively wide window is feasible to reach a few fusion events per second per cubic centimetre under the nonstationary conditions of deuteron charging and discharging. Cold fusion is not feasible under stationary lattice conditions. To confirm the cold fusion phenomena, a heavy water electrolysis experiment is carried out using biased-pulse electrolytic currents, in order to enhance the detection of cold fusion events during charging and discharging of deuterons. A cross-checking system consisting of a recoil-proton scintillation detector and a 3He thermal neutron detector is used to determine the patterns of neutron emission over time. To determine the energy of the emitted neutrons, the pulse-height spectra of the recoil-proton detector are monitored. For a deuterium charging time of 300 h, neutron yields of 1 to 2 n/s-cm3 are obtained for time intervals of 60 to 200 h. From the recoil-proton spectra, it is confirmed that 2.45-MeVneutrons from the D(d, n)3He fusion branch reaction are emitted.

Facilitated by isospin restrictions that limit conventional pathways, the excess heat is driven by the reconfiguration to the more tightly bound 4 He ground state. A temperature rise occurs as well-mixed acoustical and optical phonons are unable to carry off all the local momentum and excess energy of the reactions. Four-vector analysis indicates conservation of energy, which suggests the use of a fusion quantum of energy delivered to the lattice's phonon cloud: a phuson. Special relativistic considerations indicate that the phonon cloud subtends -450 to 800 unit cells and can couple with de-excitation times >0.1 fs. Thus, commensurate levels of neutrons and gammas are not required because of unique isospin and energy restrictions that facilitate the alternate Bosecooperative pathway leading from the excited state.",

A single Pd90Rh10 cathode generated a total apparent excess energy on the order of 10 kJ after a series of additions in an experiment that only took one week.

In this work we study generalizations of these models to include higher-order dependence on loading, temperature-dependent O-site energies, and also to include T-site occupation.  xperimental data sets for 10 isotherms were assembled, and augmented with additional extrapolated points for the low-pressure a-phase region as well as the high pressure ?-phase region. Loading-dependent O-site energies are optimized by minimizing the mean square error in the chemical potential between the model and data set. The resulting models give a good match to the phase diagram. If the O-site energy is allowed to be temperature dependent then the fit is better, but the resulting optimum is a mathematical optimum not so closely connected with the physical system. Models were studied in which O-site and T-site occupation occurs. When optimized these models are able to provide a good match to the phase diagram. When the O-site to T-site excitation energy is fixed according to estimates developed in earlier studies, the resulting temperature-dependent O-site energies are physically plausible. When the excitation energy are optimized together with the O-site energy, the resulting optimum is a mathematical one much less connected to the physical system. An earlier analysis of solubility in the a-phase led to a strong argument that T-site occupation occurs in palladium hydride and in palladium deuteriude; the present study supports this conclusion based on an independent data set.",

The question of whether or not this 1993 theory has any predictive power regarding the 2003 Letts-Cravens effect is considered and answered as: \"partially.\" That is, the \"optimal\" range of wavelengths includes that discovered by Letts and Cravens, but because of the possibility of multi-photon reactions it does not uniquely single out their 680 nm as best, which would require a more detailed model (including e.g. cathode temperature) than provided by the simplified 1993 theory.",

The first time this was suggested was in the Spring of 1989, ten years ago, by Fleischmann and Pons (1): their experiment gave rise to much turmoil all over the world, ending within a few months with the scientific community rejecting the experiment and thus this interpretation. Research in CF continued nevertheless in a few laboratories, mostly in the USA, Japan, Italy, Russia and China; International Conferences were held regularly, roughly every 1.5 years. However, after ten years, in spite of undeniable (although not overwhelming) progress in the field, there is hardly any communication between this small CF community and the scientific world at large.",

Pd foils, thin enough to allow all protons produced to escape the foil, were electrolytically charged with deuterium. A Si(SB) detector was placed close to the Pd foil during charging in order to detect any protons emitted. The deuterium content was measured to be the expected 0.7 D per Pd. Monte Carlo simulations were made to estimate the detection efficiency of 3.02 MeV protons produced in the Pd foil. The background in the experiment was so low that fusion rates considerably lower than those reported on by Jones et al. could be detected.

The neutron counting rate, averaged over a 5 minute interval, was a couple of orders of magnitude larger than that of background count rates.

A suitable candidate must include an initially excited nucleus that can be produced from a commercially available radioactive source, and two final excited states in stable nuclei, where the energy mismatch is sufficiently small that it can be made up by the exchange of a few optical laser photons.

A high deuterium concentration in palladium is needed for application to solid-state fusion. The first deuterium enrichment scheme makes use of plasma ion implantation, which consists of a cylindrical palladium rod (target) preloaded with deuterium atoms, coated with diffusion barrier material, and immersed in a deuterium plasma. The palladium rod is connected to a high-power modulator, which provides a series of negative voltage pulses. During these negative pulses, deuterium ions fall on the target, penetrate the diffusion barrier, and are implanted inside the palladium. For reasonable system parameters allowed by current technology, theoretical calculations indicate that the saturation deuterium density after prolonged ion implantation can be several times the palladium atomic number density. The second deuterium enrichment scheme makes use of temperature gradient effects on the deuterium solubility in palladium. A heat source at temperature T2 and a heat sink at temperature T1 (where T2> Tj) are in contact with two different parts of a palladium sample, which has been presoaked with deuterium atoms and has been coated with diffusion barrier material or has been securely locked in a metal case. The temperature gradient created in the sample from such an arrangement forces the deuterium atoms in the hot region to migrate into the cold region, resulting in higher deuterium density in the cold region",

In many cases the treatment causes a microstructural change and, consequently, a change of the surface thermal properties. In the pal1adium-hydrogen compounds the loading process generates both a high hydrogen concentration and a high concentration gradient at the surface which creates a stress field [2] . Such a situation could inhibit the heat conduction and diffusion because of the production of defects and dislocations [3]. In this sense the thermal diffusivity may be correlated to the hydrogen concentration providing a supplementary information about the quality of the loading processes.",

Excess heating at the levels of F&P would have been easily detected, if present. Intrinsic tritium, differing from each D2O bottle tested, was however observed. The longest duration experiment ran for 21 days, and was an attempt to duplicate the large \u201cmelting incident\u201d of F&P. This was terminated on April 28, 1989, by throwing the vacuum-cast 22 gram, deuterium-loaded palladium cathode directly into liquid nitrogen, immediately next to a bare BF3 counter (backed by 25 cm of moderator), in order to attempt one of the Italian ENEA neutron production variants. No neutrons above backgrounds were seen, while counting for 1 hour, and also none while the piece warmed to room temperature over the next hour. Post-mortem analysis of the darkened, hardened Pd piece showed large crystal grains (up to 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm), and continuing evolution of gas bubbles at the grain boundaries even days after the experiment was ended. eight weeks after loading, the catalytically-active palladium piece continued to create heavy water (with exposure to oxygen in the air).",

With the vibrations, one deals with a large amplitude (fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small group of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as discrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs. On the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are represented by very large amplitude (angstrom) oscillations of atoms between two quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude atomic motion in LAVs and phasons may result in time-periodic driving of adjacent potential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons). The rate of tunneling of the particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is shown to be drastically enhanced by the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs that can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.",

We focused on three characteristics to describe the LENR environment: (1) a high hydrogen isotope loading ratio, (2) the presence of dopants or impurities, and (3) material morphology. We chose two figures of merit to characterize those environments: hydrogen adsorption energy on metal surface and H2 bond length. We showed that high hydrogen loading and the presence of impurities in Pd and Ni can lower the adsorption energy, thus increasing hydrogen surface mobility potentially improving the reaction rate. Another factor that would increase the fusion probability is the distance between two hydrogen atoms.

It models Bloch symmetry deuterons in a 2-dimensional metal lattice instead of the 3-dimensional metal lattice first used. Both IBS variants recognize that the required lattice symmetry has limited extent, with the reactive deuterons being bound inside a closed volume like a box. The reactive deuterons are confined within classical turning point boundaries, while within the box their density distributions are modulated by a lattice array potential. Strictly speaking, the IBS fusion theory is a many-body theory. Nuclear dd fusion is one of several LENR processes. Some LENR processes do not require many-body ions and support room temperature nuclear reactions using light ions in single-particle Bloch geometry. For example, the decay of metastable single-body Bloch-function 8Be seems to be the source of MeV alphas in Oriani's light/heavy water electrolysis, and in several co-deposition electrolysis CR39 studies, as described in ICCF14 Abstracts. The Oriani MeV alphas are side products of both light water and heavy water electrolysis, using either Pd or Ni cathodes, as shown in highly repeatable tests. Bloch 8Be is likely the nuclearly reactive component in the final step of the Iwamura et al. transmutation studies. Despite differences, all LENR systems seem to share some essential physics.",

It was estimated that about 108 to 1010 tritium generating lenr reactions take place in these hot spots accompanied by a very small fraction of neutrons. During the last few years several researchers have reported detecting a variety of transmutation reaction products in localized sites, often associated with some type of crater formation. Other experimenters have reported online detection of flashes of \"thermal hot spots\" in their cathodes. It is therefore tempting to speculate that perhaps the concept of micro-nuclear explosions can be extended to heat generating helium producing reactions too, as well as nuclear reactions responsible for transmutation products. Many theoretical models such as those that depend on the catalyzing role of some exotic intermediate agent (such as Bose-Einstein condensates, deuteron clusters, Erzions, poly neutrons, trapped neutrons etc) seem to point to the possibility of occurrence of chain events. Two decades into the CMNS era, it is therefore worthwhile reexamining the merits of the micro-nuclear explosion hypothesis and seek independent experimental evidence to either corroborate or refute such a hypothesis.",

By applying fast pulses of several hundred volts and tens of nanoseconds long, the current follows the \"skin-effect\" principle and is concentrated at the Ni?ceramic interface but returns through the bulk of the Cu. Two stimulation methods were used ? steady-state and dynamic. In the steady-state method, the pulse power is measured directly using fast oscilloscopes that record the voltage across the tube and a shunt resistor in series with the tube. The resistance of the shunt resistor is measured accurately under DC and pulse conditions. The input pulse power is determined by multiplying the calculated root-mean-square voltage and current and recorded every 10 s. Using a sophisticated model of the calorimeter with up to 15 coefficients, the power reaching the five temperature sensors is determined during simultaneous continuous ramps of both heater and pulse powers. The power emanating from the tube is determined during sequences of more frequent low voltage pulses (LVP) and compared to that found using less frequent high voltage pulses (HVP). The power determined during the more frequent LVP is set as the input power during that sequence. The power of the stimulation pulses during the less frequent HVP sequences is maintained equal to that during the more frequent LVP. Then the power calculated from the tube is divided by that calculated during the reference sequences, giving a so-called coefficient of performance (COP).

The change in temperature was forced on the electrolysis cell while it was producing nuclear energy at excess power levels of 240?W/cm3 and after producing a continuous excess heat amount of 150?MJ/cm3 (14?000?eV/atom of Pd). The temperature change (from 82.5??C to ~0??C) resulted in a total loss of excess power (nuclear power) and indicates the regions of the microstructure that were ordered superabundant vacancy (SAV) phase transformed from d to the ordered superabundant vacancy phase d'. The d phase is responsible for producing excess heat and power while the d' phase produces no excess heat or power. Deuterium in the d phase occupies the octahedral sites but occupies the tetrahedral sites in the d' phase. In either case, d and d' are minor phases with volume fractions in the two-phase microstructure of approximately 0.03 and 5.0 percent for d and d', respectively.

This has motivated us over the years to focus attention on models in which a large quantum is fractionated into a great many small quanta. We have found that many two-level systems with a large transition energy are able to exchange energy coherently with an oscillator with a much smaller characteristic energy as long as decay channels are present in the vicinity of the two-level transition energy. In previous work we analyzed this basic model, and obtained estimates for the coherent energy exchange rate in the strong coupling limit. In this work we consider a version of this model where the upper states of the two-level systems are unstable. In this case, there is no coherent energy exchange, but instead we find a dynamical polarization effect which we have analyzed. We extend the model to the case of three-level systems, and generalize the result to apply to general N-level systems. Coherent energy exchange is possible within the context of a donor and receiver model, where the receiver transitions have unstable upper states. We give results for the donor dynamics in this case. This model provides a foundation for a new kind of model that we put forth recently for which the predictions appear to be closely connected to experiment.",

This effort documented the fact that the excess heat that FP observed is the result of a form of nuclear fusion that can occur in solids at reduced temperature, dynamically, through a deuteron (d)+d\u001f4He reaction, without high-energy particles or gamma  rays. A key reason this fact has not been accepted is the lack of a cogent argument, based on fundamental physical ideas, justifying it. In the paper, this question is re-examined, based on a generalization of conventional energy band theory that applies to finite, periodic solids, in which d?s are allowed to occupy wave-like, ion band states, similar to the kinds of states that  electrons occupy in ordinary metals. Prior to being experimentally observed, the Ion Band State Theory (IBST) of cold fusion predicted a potential d+d => 4He reaction, without high energy particles, would explain the excess heat, the 4He would be found in an unexpected place (outside heat-producing electrodes), and high-loading, x\u001f1, in PdDx, would be required.",

    "abstract": "In heavily (deuterated or hydrogenated) palladium, some of the crystallinity is lost. As a consequence, the localized phonon modes of the crystal/damaged-region interface have a much higher frequency than the host. These high-frequency modes create electrostatic fields that interact strongly with electrons of the local atoms. A resulting instantaneous potential inversion, from polarization, leads to the formation of lochons (local charged bosons-electron pairs in the singlet state, perhaps isolated from the Pd d-orbital energy levels) and of an associated H+ or D+ ion (with its two shared electrons instantaneously isolated into the adjacent Pd d-levels). The Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei of these pairs is greatly reduced by strong screening from the lochons that can even generate an attractive polarization potential. Furthermore, the mutual tunneling penetration probability of the Coulomb barrier is enhanced by correlated fluctuations. This arises from the generalized uncertainty relations, \u0001x \u0001px,\u0001E \u0001t = (n + 1/2)h/(1 - ?2)0.5, where n may be on the order of 10-100 and where results from two models are combined. The integer n values represent excitations in the phonon modes of the H or D sub-lattice and ? is the correlation coefficient with 0 < ? < 1. Higher values of nand ?, for a particle in a potential well, imply less localization and greater uncertainties in location (i.e., extending its probability distribution further into the barrier).

The coherency and persistence of LAVs may have a drastic effect on quantum tunneling due to correlation effects discovered by Schr?dinger and Robertson in 1930. These effects have been applied to the tunneling problem by a number of authors, who demonstrated a giant increase of sub-barrier transparency during the increase of the correlation coefficient at a special high-frequency periodic action on the quantum system. Recently, it has been proposed that discrete breathers (a sub-class of LAVs arising in periodic systems) present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation effects in regular crystals due to time-periodic modulation of the potential well (or the Coulomb barrier) width and hence to act as breather ?nano-colliders? catalyzing low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids. It has been shown that the tunneling probability for D?D fusion under electrolysis of heavy water increases enormously with increasing number of oscillations resulting in the fusion rates comparable with those observed experimentally. In the present paper, we discuss possible ways of engineering the nuclear-active environment (NAE) and catalyzing LENR in NAE based on the LAV concept. We propose some practical ways of catalyzing LENR that are based on a special electro-magnetic treatment or electron and gamma irradiation, which could trigger LAVs in crystals and clusters.",

    "abstract": "In the light of experiments by Fleischmann and Pons [1] and Jones et al. [2], several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed to justify fusion events in palladium and titanium electrodes saturated by deuterium. In particular, most of these mechanisms requires that a high deuterium content in palladium (c = D/Pd higher than 0.67 at room temperature) has to be locally established in order to justify a significant fusion rate. A critical value for the deuterium content is also predicted to have to be raised in electrode regions of about 10 #m to obtain the nuclear process [3]. Therefore, thermodynamic arguments concerning the possibility of a local oversaturation of deuterium during D 2 evolution at palladium or titanium cathodes under atmospheric pressure is of relevant importance. In face, the c value obtained from the Pd/D 2 absorption isotherm (i.e. under thermodynamic equilibrium) at 1 atm of deuterium partial pressure is smaller than 0.7 [4]. Following those considerations, some doubts concerning the occurrence of high c values in the electrode simultaneously with the establishment of negative overpotentials, as suggested by Fleischmann and Pons [1], have been already stressed in the literature [5]. The aim of the present paper is to give just an idea of how a deuterium overconcentration can be reached in domains of few micrometres of a palladium electrode, by considering the key role both of the electrode internal structure and the non-equilibrium conditions imposed by the electrolytic process.",

These clusters are proposed to hide their Coulomb barrier and to react with isolated deuterons to produce fusion and to react with larger nuclei to produce transmutation. Members of the cluster not directly involved in the nuclear reaction might be scattered by the released energy, thereby allowing momentum to be conserved and the resulting energy to produce particles having energy too small to be easily detected or to cause easily detectable secondary reactions.? Justification of this model is discussed. This proposed model is consistent with most observations, but raises additional questions about the nature of such super-clusters and other ways the energy may be communicated directly to the lattice that will be addressed in future papers.",

In 22 different electrolytic experiments whose cathode surface areas ranged from 0.1 to 300 cm^2, large bursts of neutrons and/or tritium were measured. Some of these gave clear evidence that these two nuclear particles were being generated simultaneously. The neutron-to-tritium yield ratios in the majority of these experiments was in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-9. The specific neutron and tritium yields expressed per cm^2 of cathode surface area also fitted into a systematic pattern.

A great deal of effort has been applied to understanding how this can be accomplished and the nature of the resulting structure. The bulk properties play a role in this process but are sensitive to the impurity content and treatment. The influence of the bulk properties on this process has not been fully explored.This paper describes a new method to directly measure the bond energy between the PdH structure and the contained H atoms in real time as a function of H/Pd ratio from zero to the maximum H content using the electrolytic method and H2SO4+H2O to react Pd with H. A unique and very accurate calorimeter (+/-5 mW) is used to measure power during the loading reaction. This method is applied to several types of Pd including commercial Pd sheet, extra pure Pd, and a zone refine single-crystal of Pd after each is subjected to several treatments. These treatments include repeated loading-deloading cycles, annealing at 900?C, and reduction in thickness. The bond energy is found to be sensitive to purity, treatment, and H/Pd ratio, with good agreement with published measurements being achieved after certain treatments. In addition, three methods to measure the average H/Pd ratio are described and compared. These methods use weight gain, orphaned oxygen, and recombiner temperature. A great deal of information about the reaction process can be obtained by combining these three methods because they are sensitive to different possible errors and behaviours.",

This had lead to the identification of three (3) distinct regions of their electrical operation. We now report that the optimal power gain of NANOR R-type cold fusion components is found far below the breakdown voltage and that the power gain decreases continuously as the electrical avalanche threshold is approached. Beyond the region of electrical avalanche, the previously active preloaded LANR quantum electronic components then give a thermal output similar to a standard ohmic control (a carbon composition resistor). Therefore, use of this technique of driving an active CF/LANR nanomaterial component into, and beyond, their avalanche threshold, provides verification of the excess heat an additional way, which confirms that the calorimetry was calibrated. Also, this investigation indicates where, on the input power axis, to drive them for a maximum effective use.

Measuring and finding He produced in a vacuum tight reactor with no air leaks where mass spectral (MS) system analyses numbers would be disturbed. The only He to deal with was in the reactor?s pressurizing tank of Ar and that value of 0.10 ppm was subtracted from all measurements. Two systems were analyzed. In one, HOH and Cu produced 1.7Wfor 45 min. and in system two, DOD and Pd/6% Ag produced a burst of 6 W for 250 s. A comparison was made between cavitation and muon systems. A very slow rate muon system also produced He. The two impulse systems, Isw and I mu, were compared, and the cavitating system?s impulse was 60 times greater than the muon system. The two systems differ. The cavitation system was explosive, and the muon system was implosive. The cavitation system was fueled by 15.5 eV of energy, and the muon system was fueled by 23.8?10^+6 eV of energy. The cavitation system reaction rate was 1.6?10^-15 s, and the muon system was 10-6 s.

There are also significant differences between lochon- and muon-catalyzed fusion (e.g., one leads to ?cold' fusion and the other the ?hot' fusion). However, since muon-catalyzed fusion is an accepted phenomenon and Lattice-assisted Nuclear Reaction (LANR) or Low-energy Nuclear Reaction ( LENR) is not, we will examine the similarities and differences in various mechanisms with the fusion of deuterons in mind. We start with the assumption that both solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are actually real and the one that has here-to-for been rejected correctly identifies a single deep orbit below the n = 1 ground state. (It is generally accepted that, at least for spinless bosons such as the lochon, this solution of the Klein-Gordon equation holds.) We then compare the creation model and characteristics of these two naught orbits with those of the muonic orbits (both atomic and molecular). The similarities lead both naught-orbit and muonic-orbit molecules to fusion. The differences lead the non-relativistic (but >100 MeV excess energy) muon-induced fusion of deuterons to the fragmentation of excited helium nuclei and the relativistic (but <10 eV excess energy) lochon-induced D-D fusion to an excited helium 4He* state that is below these fragmentation levels. The reason for this different response to the respective \"tight\" orbits is described along with some of the consequences, e.g., electron capture. In addition, internal conversion, a known physical process involving nucleon interaction with atomic electrons, is compared with the Extended Lochon Model to provide a means of de-exciting 4He* without production of energetic particles or radiation.",

When we modeled collimated X-ray emission in the Karabut experiment, we found that the conditions required by the model did not match the conditions of the experiment. One possible reason for this might be the neglect of phonon ?uctuations due to coupling with conduction electrons. We would like to add a description of this effect to our phonon?nuclear model; however, models normally used for electron?phonon interactions in metals are based on the Bloch picture, and we were concerned that it may not be well suited to the problem. This has motivated us to develop a new model for phonon ?uctuations in a metal that is based on the Born?Oppenheimer picture, within the context of a Brillouin?Wigner formulation. The Born?Oppenheimer results are complicated, so we have reduced them in a simpler ?xed-point picture (which is based on a Taylor series expansion of the Born?Oppenheimer approximation around ?xed nuclear equilibrium points). In order to verify the resulting formalism, we constructed a simpli?ed model for the monatomic crystal phonon dispersion relation, which is well known in the Bloch picture literature. From this model we are able to extract the longitudinal dielectric constant. We ?nd that the ?xed-point dielectric constant at second order is more accurate than the Bloch picture equivalent, and that it includes dynamic corrections that match the result from ?eld theory up to O(?2). This model is used in a subsequent paper for the development of phonon ?uctuation models, where it is found that the Bloch picture is appropriate when the metal sample is micron scale or larger, and that the Born?Oppenheimer picture is appropriate for nano-scale samples.",

The excess power reportedly occurs in palladium electrodes highly loaded with deuterium. Other anomalous effects such helium-4, tritium and low energy radiation production have also been reported. This report summarizes the experimental results from a number of electrochemical loading/calorimetric experiments on palladium electrodes run at NRL. The experiments were carried out with the purpose of replicating the published excess power results obtained at the other Navy laboratories and with the goal of identifying the experimental conditions necessary to produce anomalous effects. Most of the experiments described were attempts to electrolytically load pure palladium or palladium alloy cathodes with deuterium (or hydrogen) and then to measure the power produced in the electrolytic cells. Loading was monitored in situ by measuring the change in the axial resistance of the cathode and comparing the measure values with the known relationship between resistance and the D(H)/Pd atomic ratios. While attaining high levels of deuterium loading in palladium cathodes was difficult we found that using materials with a large grain microstructure facilitated the loading. Calorimetric measurements on the highly loaded cathodes were initially made in isoperibol calorimeters that had a sensitivity of ?10%. No excess power (200 mW) and no radiation above the background were measured in any of the experiments described. Highly sensitive heat conduction calorimeters were evaluated for their use with the electrochemical cells. Results showed that measurements at the ?10 mW level were possible in the heat conduction calorimeters when data were collected frequently and signal averaging was used. Another experiment that was investigated was the electrochemical codeposition of palladium and deuterium on cathodes. Again, no radiation above background levels was detected in these experiments.",

The cost of generators is likely to fall by a factor of 200, from $2,000/kW to $10/kW, which is the cost difference between a power company central generator and a portable gasoline generator.A radical reduction in the cost of one device does not always reduce the cost of others. Since 1900, the cost of illumination has fallen by a factor of 80, but this has not directly reduced the cost of other goods and services by a similar factor. Since 1970, the cost of computer memory has fallen by a factor of 108. Microprocessors and cheap memory enhanced many products. They brought us the Internet and ubiquitous cheap computing. But so far they have not drastically lowered costs outside of computer applications. Cold fusion is different. All machines use energy, so cold fusion will lower the cost of everything, but it will have the biggest impact replacing large, expensive machines with small mass-produced versions. Other new sources of energy such as solar panels also have zero cost fuel, but they will not reduce the cost of other machines. Only cold fusion can do this.It follows that the most profitable use of cold fusion in the first decades after it is introduced will be to replace existing technology, rather than to make radical new technology. Microprocessors brought us machines we did not have, such as cell phones and the Internet. Cold fusion will ? at first ? dramatically lower the cost of machines we already have.",

For example, in fractofusion the mechanism is identical to hot fusion (it is not LENR), and the reaction products are the same as those of hot fusion. Cold fusion operates under a different mechanism. Storms assumes that hot fusion operates under the basic laws of thermodynamics which explain the data observed. On the other hand, cold fusion operates under the laws of statistics. This is the explanation of the different behaviors between hot and cold fusion. . . .",

We also employed a continuous wave He-Ne laser to irradiate the samples inside the chamber during the treatment, in order to increase the gas absorption. Using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an electron probe micro-analyzer (EDX), we observed structures like spots on the surface of the treated samples. Inside the spots, elements other than Pd were found. Based on these results, we determined that gas loading is an effective way to transmute elements, and the laser action has been a very effective way to increase morphological changes in the treated samples.",

The D+D+D fusion, 3D\u2192t+3He+9.5 MeV, has been observed repeatedly in deuteron-beam irradiation experiments with a TiDx target. On the other hand, in proton-beam experiments with TiDx, H+D+D-fusion: H+D+D\u2192p+4He+23.8 MeV was observed. Considering this result, it seems that the 3D reaction occurred between two deuterons trapped closely in TiDx and an incident particle of deuteron. . . .",

The hydrogen electrode potential is converted to 'equivalent hydrogen pressure', which might signify gaseous pressure in a void or on a surface.

A LEC converts the internal energy within the lattice of some materials, such as palladium, or of gases occluded within the lattice, such as hydrogen or deuterium, into ionizing radiation and electrical energy. Experiments include tests where the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the LEC were measured when an external voltage/current was applied, as well as other I-V tests where the spontaneous LEC voltage was measured as a function of temperature and resistance. LEC voltage and current has been shown to increasewith increased temperature. The electrical power produced by a LEC is similar to that produced by a nuclear battery however, a LEC does not require radioactive materials. While the energy levels produced to date are several orders of magnitude below those required formost power sources, the calculated flux of ionizing radiation necessary to produce the experimentally measured voltage and currentwould require the equivalent of several curies of radiation. These results have been independently replicated by two individuals.

    "abstract": "The hydrogen evolution reaction model was proposed many years ago by the founders of modern electrochemistry. The closely related deuterium evolution reaction model describes deuterium loading in Pd cathodes in the Fleischmann?Pons experiment. We were interested in what issues were involved in the development of a high D/Pd loading, since over the years the importance of obtaining a high D/Pd ratio to obtain excess heat has been emphasized. In order to simplify things, we focus on the Volmer and Tafel reactions, and develop a steady state adsorption isotherm for the Vomer-Tafel regime. The adsorption isotherm is extended to become an absorption isotherm within a simplified picture that takes the surface sites to be equivalent to the bulk sites. While not a particularly good approximation, this allows us to model the D/Pd loading simply as a function of the overpotential, and hence the electrochemical current density. From a Tafel curve we can get some of the parameters for the Volmer current model, and from other eletrochemical data we can estimate the remaining Volmer and Tafel parameters. The resulting model fits the experimental data used well at low current density. Cathodes that load more highly with this approach require new models, potentially one for each cathode. We examine our earlier proposal that the differences in loading seen in experiment is due in part to large variations in the rate for internal D2 leaks. Consequently, we modify the Tafel reaction current model to account for internal leaks separately from the surface gas loss, and take advantage of data from the most highly loaded cathodes to estimate the surface Tafel reaction rate. Using this approach, the reference cathode that we used for our fits initially must have an internal leak rate more than two orders of magnitude higher than the rate of surface D2 loss. We conclude that minimizing the internal leaks is important in achieving high loading. Probably a key reason that there were so many negative results early in the field was because the cathode internal leak rate was very high in the cathodes used.",

A simpler approach, based on a Thomas-Fermi model [5J for palladium, is proposed by the authors. This semiclassical model averages the effects of all the electrons within an atom to approximate the electric field distribution everywhere. Overlapping these distr ibutions approximates the electric fields within the palladium crystal.

On the other hand, a simultaneous measurement by another QMS catched a signal of the existence of 32He, while it is considerably less existence than 42He. In comparable measurements from non-deuterated samples, any helium and deuterium were not detected. This means that there exist no well-known Rutherford type as a main reaction of the deuterium nuclear reaction within Pd host-solid, and an inherent feature of solid-state with much valency electron cloud such as Pd presents a circumstance for a new type of deuterium nuclear fusion reaction which directly produces 42He as main reaction product. Because the helium (42He, 32He) was observed only after each sample had been heated in a high vacuum, in each case, the laws of physics require that this helium could not have diffused from any outside source other than the Pd metal sample. Also because helium was observed only after the sample was heated to a relatively high temperature, in each case, it must have been trapped within an interior location of the sample. Because there is no known process that can account for the diffusion of the large amounts of helium into the interior locations of the various samples at the levels that were measured, the only possible explanation for the helium being trapped in this fashion is that it was trapped within each sample after it was first produced as the nuclear ash from an electrolytically induced (Cold Fusion) deuterium nuclear reaction. To understand these results, the authors have constructed a theory, based upon a coherent process that is believed to be induced in highly deuterated Pd black crystals. In this theory, it is postulated that Cold Fusion is initiated through the formation of a Strongly Coupled Plasma (\u201cSC-Plasma\u201d), reminiscient of the SC-plasma's that are found within stellar interiors. This postulate is consistent with the assumption that a deuterium nuclear reaction is initiated in a localized zone within a host solid, and it is indispensable that the deuterium be transformed coherently for at least a few picoseconds into a SC-plasma, which the authors refer to as a deuterium \u201ccoherent plasma\u201d within the solid-state. It is also postulated that this \u201ccoherent solid-state plasma fusion\u201d is initiated through a violent, localized vibration of the lattice, which the authors refer to as a \u201cLatticequake\u201d. This \u201cLatticequake\u201d is essentially accompanied with both of an intense electromagnetic turbulence and violently shaking electron cloud under a many body effect in coherent-state.",

Recently, a generalization of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism has been made to a ground-state mixture of two different species of positively charged bosons in harmonic traps.? The theory has been used to describe (D + Li) reactions in the low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) processes in condensed matter and predicts that the (D + Li) reaction rates can be larger than (D + D) reaction rates by as much as a factor of ~50, implying that (D + Li) reactions may be occuring in addition to the (D + D) reactions.?

    "abstract": "Replication of experiments claiming to demonstrate excess heat production in light water-Ni-K2CO3 electrolytic cells was found to produce an apparent excess heat of 11 W maximum, for 60 W electrical power into the cell. Power gains ranged from 1.06 to 1.68. The cell was operated at four different dc current levels plus one pulsed current run at 1 Hz, 10% duty cycle. The 28 liter cell used in these verification tests was on loan from a private corporation whose own tests with similar cells are documented to produce 50 W steady excess heat for a continuous period exceeding hundreds of days. The apparent excess heat can not be readily explained either in terms of nonlinearity of the cell's thermal conductance at a low temperature differential or by thermoelectric heat pumping. However, the present data do admit efficient recombination of dissolved hydrogen-oxygen as an ordinary explanation. Calorimetry methods and heat balance calculations for the verification tests are described. Considering the large magnitude of benefit if this effect is found to be a genuine new energy source, a more thorough investigation of evolved heat in the nickel-hydrogen system in both electrolytic and gaseous loading cells remains warranted.",

The registered isotopic ratio change ranged within 2-1000 times, the quantity of additional elements undetected before varying within one tenth to dozens percents in Pd and Pd alloys. The isotopes with masses less than and exceeding those of the cathode material were measured in most of the experiments. The MS revealed that the tungsten isotopes transmutated into elements lighter than tungsten, higher post-experimental intensity of mass numbers 169, 170, 171, 178 and 180 being observed. The mass spectra peaks magnituded for isotopes lighter than W isotopes increased by factors ranging from 5 to 400. The registered increase varied from 5-50 cps in the original foils to 100-20 000 cps after the exposure to deuterium GD. Lighter isotopes in tungsten and tantalum foils placed on the GD cathode after deuterium GD exposure were identified using high resolution gamma/X-ray spectrometry. The comparison of thermal ionization mass-spectrometry (TIMS) data and data of gamma-spectra energy peaks allowed to assume that the peaks series observed in gamma spectra belong to the following isotopes: 169 70 Yb, 170 72 Hf , 171m 70 Yb, 172 72 Hf and 178 70 Yb. Correlation of TIMS and Gamma spectrometry data leads to the assumption that the appearance of light isotopes in tungsten resulted from the low-energy decay process initiation caused by deuterium GD.",

The palladium rod is connected to a high-power modulator which provides a series of negative-voltage pulses. During these negative pulses, deuterium ions fall into the target, penetrate the diffusion barrier, and are implanted inside the palladium. For reasonable system parameters allowed by present technology, it is found from theoretical calculations that the saturation deuterium density after prolonged ion implantation can be several times the palladium atomic number density. Assuming an initial deuterium density, n, = 4x Id* cmm3, it is also found that the deuterium density in palladium can triple its original value within a few days of the ion implantation for a reasonable target size.

    "abstract": "At ICCF-22, we presented a vapor compression machine (VCS) which can produce excess energy. The hot refrigerant vapor from the freon compressor is used to heat the water flowing through a tiny passage of a triple-pipe heat exchanger (THX). This can cause a violent cavitation of water and two-phase flow instabilities, and produce excess energy. The VCS machine was further modified and tested for two years since then. We improved the calorimetry in measuring COP. From the energy balance of THX, we defined COP as the net heat output from water divided by the net heat input to THX, which is denoted as COPx. If the measured COPx was greater than 1, we can confirm the occurrence of excess energy generation or the low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). The test results show that the maximum COPx reaches 2.39 and COPx increases with decreasing inlet water temperature. We observed some peculiar phenomena. The output refrigerant vapor from the compressor is, instead, heated by water at some part of the heat exchanger. In addition, abnormally-high water line pressure damaged the pressure gauge, and also caused crack and leakage of the copper pipe. We also observed severe buckling and black appearance of the middle pipe. The buckling may result from a huge exerted pressure around 740 bar which is far beyond the system operating pressure. This may be caused by LENR. We also made another machine (DHX-1) using a double-pipe heat exchanger heated by a steam boiler. The maximum COPx reaches 2.55 and some peculiar phenomena similar to the VCS machine was observed. The inner copper pipe was deformed by buckling and the outer pipe wall was cracked and leaked. This may be caused by huge pressure (>225 bar) or a high temperature (>500?C) which results in buckling and rupture of the pipes. The surface of the ruptured inner pipe becomes shining black and looks like CuO nanowires produced by thermal oxidation of copper. The chemical element of the ruptured copper pipe increases by 3 to 4 folds in C, 10 folds in O, and 1.4 to 4.4 folds in Fe. Replacing the identical brand-new double-pipe heat exchanger (DHX-1B), we obtained the same results as DHX-1 with COPx > 2.0, inner pipe rupture and blackening, and chemical element change. COPx > 2.0 also occurred in a new heat exchanger (DHX-2) made from stronger copper tubes with a larger size. All of these excess-energy phenomena in VCS and DHX are probably induced by LENR. In the present study, we experimentally confirm that excess energy or LENR can be induced by a heat transfer process involving cavitation in heat-exchange systems. The excess energy process has been shown reproduceable and controllable.",

In the center of a target chamber fitted to a 300 keV deuteron accelerator, a Ti or Pd foil sample was set to face toward 3 nsec pulsed deuteron beams collimated with a 3 mm diameter aperture. A Si-SSD was placed behind the foil to detect high energy charged particles emitted from the foil by the supposed deuteron fusion reactions.In the 243 keV deuteron implantation experiments for 3-20 \u03bcm Ti and 5-22 \u03bcm Pd foils, unusual counts and peaks were measured in the energy region higher than the proton peak due to the well-known D-D reaction. And from the energy loss measurement with the screen foil in front of the Si-SSD, some of the unusual high energy peaks were found to be helium, though the original reactions are not identified. These helium peaks and unnatural counts are difficult to explain and might have something to do with the multibody fusion reactions proposed by A. Takahashi. More elaborate experiments with more detailed measurement such as correlated particle measurement should be necessary for confirmation of the multibody fusion reaction.",

This present paper highlights how relativity and the near-field interactions (of deep-orbit electrons with both the nucleus and the lattice) predict accepted and many reported, but not-yet-accepted, CF observations. Included in the former category are: all of the new fragmentation ratios for the D+D => 4He CF nuclear reaction; a high-probability p?e?p => d reaction; a ?fast? decay process for transitions from excited to ground nuclear states; and a means of transferring excess nuclear energy to the lattice. Included in the latter category are: energy transfer from s-orbit atomic electrons to low-lying nuclear states; the formation of femto-atoms and femto-molecules ? a basis for transmutations without the known ?hard? radiation (particulate or photonic) characteristic of neutron activation processes; selective attraction of femto-atoms/molecules to radio-nuclides (nuclear remediation); and the ?preferred? transmutation pathways in CF. Other effects, based on the published deep-orbit models, are predicted. Because of the successes of these models in explaining so much of CF, their mathematical basis is presently being explored beyond previous work(s). The physical bases for, and the consequences of, the mathematical predictions are proposed and described here. These include: special relativity and binding energy; the deBroglie term and spin-axis precessions; the deep-orbit quantum number, k; and deep-level splitting from spin?orbit, spin?spin, momentum and magnetic interactions. Theoretical concepts such as: symmetry breaking, ?sequestration?, and elementary-particle mass changes to below their rest mass are also addressed. The new results and their interpretation, while incomplete, provide both satisfaction (in resolving prior issues) and surprises (in the magnitude and variety of near-nuclear effects).",

This has allowed us simultaneous determination of both excess heat generation and deuterium loading ratio, D/Pd, in the course of long term electrolysis which lasted for nearly two months.Dependence of excess heat generation on D/Pd has been observed up to D/Pd = 0.88 with the maximum outpuVinput ratio of 1 .35. The minimum O/Pd to produce the excess heat has been found around 0.83-0.84.Dependence of O/Pd on the overvoltage and the dependence of the excess heat generation on the O/Pd suggest that the dependence of the excess heat generation on the current density reported originally by Fleischmann and Pons and later by Storms can be interpreted in terms of the dependence of the loading ratio on the electrolysis current density. In other words, higher current density is necessary to maintain the high loading ratio.",

Loading is accomplished with the cathode sitting in a magnetic field of 350 Gauss. After loading the cathode with Deuterium, Gold is co-deposited electrolytically on the cathode. When a coating of Gold is visible on the cathode, co-deposition is halted and the cathode is stimulated with a low-power laser with a maximum power of 30 milliwatts. The thermal response of the cathode is typically 500 mW with maximum output observed of approximately 1 watt. The effect is repeatable when protocols are followed and has been demonstrated in several laboratories.This file includes the paper, the PowerPoint slides, and another set of PowerPoint slides describing the dual laser cell fabrication technique.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a new hydrogen permeation model through Pd-based membranes is developed and used to analyze the role of the concentration polarization. According to this new model, the entire hydrogen permeation process is divided into several elementary steps: multicomponent mass transport in the feed and permeate side, adsorption and desorption on/from the membrane surface, absorption and de-absorption into/from the metal lattice, diffusion through the Pd-based bulk and multicomponent mass transport through an asymmetric multilayered porous support. Each of these steps is modeled by means of some equations whose solution provides as result the value of transmembrane flux and the hydrogen partial pressure profile through the membrane. The influence of each step is evaluated as a function of several operating conditions (membrane thickness, temperature, fluid-dynamic conditions, hydrogen partial pressure on feed and permeate side). The effect of the mass transfer in the feed and permeate side is evaluated in terms of concentration polarization effect by defining an opportune coefficient and analyzing its behaviour in different conditions. As results, the investigation shows that the influence of the polarization can be appreciable even for not so thin membranes and provides some \"polarization maps\", which are diagrams where the polarization level (in terms of CPC) can be directly visualized and simply estimated once knowing the external operating conditions. Hence, these maps can be very useful in order to predict better the membrane performances and, consequently, reduce the uncertainness during the design step of the membrane modules.",

In the reactor the transient cavitation bubbles, TCBs, produce billions of low energy high density jets per second that accelerate deuterons into foil targets producing excess heat, Qx.?? The Qx is determined by calorimetric measurements of experiments that use coolant water circulated to the surface of the well insulated reactor and data collected in the form of T in and T out at steadystate temperatures and coolant flow rate.? The total watts out, Qo, minus Qa ideally should equal zero, and we know that this calorimetry method has several losses that are not measured.? This makes the method very conservative when looking for Qx.? The Qx must make up those heat losses before making its presence known.? The result from experiments of system I using flow x DT x 4.184 for Qo - Qi = Qx shows that Qx values over unity are the norm.? System II used a more realistic calculation for Qx where flow x DT x 4.184 for Qo - Qa = Qx showed increased results. The calibration of the reactor with a Joule heater, JH, and substituting H2O for D2O produced measurements that showed the reactor calorimetry was close to zero Qx production as one would expect.?

Dissociated hydrogen atoms diffuse through the membrane and react with oxygen on the other side. Product water is removed by condensation at low temperatures. In this paper we analyze theory and relevant experiments concerning surface and bulk effects in hydrogen pumping with palladium membranes. Models are refined by comparison with experimental pumping data to suggest that the original pump design was limited by a low effective sticking coefficient, which apparently was caused by multiple pathways for dissociation on the palladium surface. Increased pumping speeds and increased economy should result from decreased operating temperatures, with 300\u2009\u00b0C appearing as something of an optimum. At very low temperatures, surface oxidation, surface impedence, and low permeabilities will limit throughput.

The excitation energy of the p-states is about 10?14 eV. The excited atoms? orientation in the crystal is not random but dictated by the crystal lattice?s electrostatic potentials. Calculations show that the transparency of the Coulomb potential barrier, for example, in the case of DD-fusion, increases by about 60 orders of magnitude if two deuterium atoms meet each other in the minima of the conductor?s potentials in the crisscross orientation.

Usually the crystal lattice or nano-particles (among others) are assumed to be the nuclear active environment that catalyzes the reaction somehow. In contrast, the author has built a quantum-mechanical model of the nuclear active environment in LENR, where this environment is modeled as an ultra-dense plasmoid, i.e. a \"condensed plasmoid\" (CP). The computed properties of CPs are so exotic that CPs qualify as a previously unknown aggregation state of matter. The quantum-mechanical model of CPs is based on the cylindrical symmetry of a very thin (i.e. about 40 pm) plasma \"wire\". (The quantitative properties given in the abstract depend on the configuration of the CP; these are just examples.) The electrons of a CP are fully delocalized and decoupled from the nuclei. They are moving with high velocity (10?80% of light speed) against the nuclei. This results in an intrinsic current of about 9 kA in the CP with a mean current density of approximately 2.5 A/pm2. The magnetic field from this current reaches 50 MT (magatesla) and creates a confinement pressure of more than 1021 Pa. The electrons are compressed by the strong z-pinch condition to a mean density of about 0.15 electrons/pm3. The creation of a CP is an endothermic process (i.e. it takes in energy from an external source), which typically requires discharges with high voltages and high currents. Once created, these objects can be long-living (lasting hours). The minimum distance of hydrogen nuclei in a CP is only about 2 pm, which enables tunneling of nuclei through the Coulomb barrier, i.e. nuclear fusion. The barrier is also much screened by the dense electrons.",

The one surface 11A side of the structure body 11, for example, is made a region in which the pressure of the deuterium is high due to pressure or electrolysis and the like, and the other surface 11B side, for example, is a region in which the pressure of the deuterium is low due to vacuum exhausting and the like, and thereby, a flow of deuterium in the structure body 11 is produced, and nuclide transmutation is carried out by a reaction between the deuterium and the material 14 that undergoes nuclide transmutation.",

The announcement, which came to be known as \"Cold Fusion,\" caused frenzied excitement. In both the scientific and news communities, fax machines were used to pass along fragments of rumor and \"facts.\" (Yes, this was before wide spread use of the internet. One can only imagine what would happen now.) Companies and individuals rushed to file patents on yet to be proven ideas in hopes of winning the grand prize. Unfortunately, the phenomenon described by Fleischmann and Pons was far from being understood and even factors necessary for repeatability of the experiments were unknown. Over the next few months, the scientific community became divided into the \"believers\" and the \"skeptics.\" The \"believers\" reported the results of their work with enthusiasm that at times overstated the significance of their results. On the other hand, many \"skeptics\" rejected the anomalous behavior of the polarized Pd/D system as a matter of conviction, i.e., without analyzing the presented material and always asking \"where are the neutrons?\" Funding for research quickly dried up as anything related to \"Cold Fusion\" was portrayed as a hoax and not worthy of funding.

Although it was suggested by Gary Taubes in discussion with some ofour investigators in the latter part of 1989 that tritium might have been added to the experimental cells by someone anxious to be able to report evidence of a nuclear process, our early and continued investigation of this possibility so far has failed to yield any evidence that this occurred. Currently it is believed by researchers at our Cyclotron Institute that the appearance of tritium arises mainly because of impurities in the materials from which the cells were constructed",

Despite these perceived irregularities scientists, worldwide, went into their laboratories to replicate the Fleischmann?Pons results. A few scientists succeeded but a great many more failed. It is now known that those failures were due to the fact that the experimental conditions necessary to achieve the effect, i.e., high D loading and high D flux inside the Pd lattice, had not been achieved.

Very weak neutron emission was detected to show an inversely proportional correlation to the excess heat variation. To explain the observed anomalous results including our past results, the theoretical model of competing multibody deuteron fusions in transient PdDx lattice has been extended. It can explain most experimental results. Cold fusion may be the multibody fusion of hydrogen isotopes in the metal lattice.",

Projects under the LENR Research Documentation Initiative (LRDI) generally begin with a site visit where information is collected and interviews are conducted.

The LRDI includes a major outreach effort to ensure participation and promote the overall standing of cold fusion. Future plans for the initiative call for additional participants and more in-depth coverage of research documented in previous projects. An integrated LRDI report including summaries of the individual projects is being prepared. Documentation of the large body of LENR research is essential both for the field and for humankind generally.

    "abstract": "Limitations to contemporary models of Coulomb and nuclear interactions have previously been identified in the development of low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) theories based on experimental Cold Fusion (CF) results. However, relativistic quantum mechanics has already provided a means to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, this ?anomalous? solution has been repeatedly rejected, based on the mathematical formalism of an assumed singular potential, simply because it has not been necessary heretofore in the description of available physical data. The physical realities of a non-singular potential and its interaction with a relativistic electron are not new physics and provide a solid theoretical basis for CF (as indicated in another paper in this conference, and the references therein) and for new fields in femto-physics and nuclear chemistry. This present paper is essentially a reasoned complaint against those critics who proclaim the limitations of the anomalous solution, yet ignore the inapplicability of their chosen potential to the real world where they claim the solution(s) fail. It also castigates those physicists who accept the mathematical limitations as applicable to the real world even when presented with the evidence of assumptions made where they are no longer valid. The paper picks a few of these alleged limitations and shows how relativity and near-field interactions alter predictions based on the mathematical models and approximations used to characterize the conventionally accepted observations. It identifies where the simple models fail, or violate physical reality, and points to the implications of extending the models to better fit the real world and to properly understand the physical mechanism(s) involved.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses Radio Frequency (RF) applied to cavitating D2O, resulting in jet plasma implantation of charged separated electrons and a deuteron-compressed plasma pulse; these interactions involved hot charged particles at an effective temperature of 104 K in a sub-picosecond time frame A. Free electrons were focused on clustered deuterons that compressed the deuterons like a spherical piston, squeezing a Meso-Cluster (MC) of deuterons. The compressed clusters were different from the deuterium clusters used by A. Takahashi. A reaction pathway similar to muon fusion was observed. The RF applied at a deuteron resonance, produced charge neutrality in the plasma?s electromagnetic (EM) pathway where alpha production was observed. Each MC consisted of 2?100 deuterons. Here we will use 10 deuterons to describe the MC and its alpha production, within time frame A. The changing MC density, pressure, and temperature were critical to alpha production, within time frame A. The MC volume was about 10-39 m3 and compression force was continuously applied to the MC located at the target foil (TF) surface. The heat transport was fast, and MCs were confined by electromagnetic fields (EM) tangent to the MC interface and motion of the neutralizing electrons. It is conjectured in this paper that the neutralizing plasma in time frame A produced a shockwave (SW) using a single electron to form a D atom that fused two deuterons in the MC to create an alpha. Before the fusion reaction, the surface target foil atoms were cavitating for an active period of 100 ns duration with each RF cavitation resonance cycle (see the main text in Fig 4).  . . .",

    "abstract": "In many crystals with sufficient anharmonicity, special kinds of lattice vibrations, namely, discrete breathers (DBs) can be excited either thermally or by external triggering, in which the amplitude of atomic oscillations greatly exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons). Coherency and persistence of large atomic oscillations in DBs may have drastic effect on quantum tunneling due to correlation effects discovered by Schr?dinger and Robertson in 1930. These effects have been applied recently to the tunneling problem by Vysotskii et al:, who demonstrated a giant increase of sub-barrier transparency during the increase of the correlation coefficient at special high-frequency periodic action on the quantum system. In the present paper, it is argued that DBs present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation effects due to time-periodic modulation of the potential well width (or the Coulomb barrier width) and hence to act as breather ?nano-colliders? (BNC) triggering low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids. The tunneling probability for deuterium (D?D) fusion in ?gap DBs? formed in metal deuterides is shown to increase with increasing numbers of oscillations by \u0018190 orders of magnitude, resulting in the observed LENR rate at extremely low concentrations of DBs.

High fugacity of deuterium was developed in unalloyed palladium via electrolysis (0.5 molar electrolyte of lithium deuteroxide, LiOD) with the use of an independent electromigration current.  In situ resistivity measurements of Pd were used to assay activity of D in the Pd lattice (ratio of D/Pd) and employed as an indicator of phase changes.  During this period, two run-away events were triggered by suddenly increasing current density resulting in 100 percent excess power (2.4 watts output with 1.2 watts input) and necessitating temporary cut back in electrolysis current.  The average excess power (excluding run-away) ranged from 4.7 ? 0.15 to 9.6 ? 0.30 percent of input power while input power ranged from 2.000 to 3.450 watts, confirming the Fleischmann-Pons effect.  The precision was: Power In = +/- .0005 W; Delta T = +/- .05?C; Power Out = +/- .015 W for an overall precision of +/- 0.5%.  High fugacity was required for these results, and the triggered run-away events required even higher fugacity.

We need to sum over all energies of the intermediate state. Since the energy of this state is unconstrained, we get contributions from very high energies for which the barrier penetration factor is not necessarily small. By considering fusion of 1H and 2H to form 3He, we determine the conditions under which this mechanism leads to fusion at observable rates. We show that this mechanism works only inside a medium and not in free space. We show that a clear experimental signature of this process is emission of two photons in coincidence whose total energy is related to the Q value of this process. Hence this process can be confirmed or ruled by the presence or absence of such photons in the final state.",

Excess power results, the power density and details on the combinations of cathode and electrolyte are also presented. The results reveal that a higher excess power density was obtained using thin film metal cathodes than thin foils. Another interesting result is that the excess power density appears to be correlated with the current density along the cathode.

Despite the great amount of experimental results coming from the so-called Cold Nuclear Fusion and Low Energy Nuclear Reactions research activities, the comprehension of these phenomena still remains unanswered. On the other hand, as reported by most of the articles devoted to Cold Nuclear Fusion, one of the principal features is the appearance of micro-cracks on the electrode surfaces after the experiments. In the present paper, a mechanical explanation is proposed considering a new kind of nuclear reactions, the piezonuclear  fissions, which are a consequence of hydrogen embrittlement of the electrodes during electrolysis. The experimental activity was conducted using a Ni?Fe anode and a Co?Cr cathode immersed in a potassium carbonate solution. Emissions of neutrons and alpha particles were measured during the experiments and the electrode compositions were analyzed both before and after the electrolysis, recognizing the effects of piezonuclear fissions occurring in the host lattices. The symmetrical fission of Ni appears to be the main and most evident feature. Such reaction would produce two Si atoms or two Mg atoms with additional fragments as alpha particles.",

We examine discrete and continuum versions of the approximation, and find that they give good results for the solutions and for the self-energy.

The coherence model of condensed matter affirms that within a deuteron-loaded palladium lattice there are three different plasmas: electrons, ions and deuterons plasma. Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can take place on the octahedrical sites or in the tetrahedral in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called ?-plasma the deuterons plasma in the octahedral site and ?-plasma which in tetrahedral. We propose a general model of effective local time-dependent deuteron?deuteron potential, that takes into account the electrons and ions plasma oscillations. The main features of this potential are extracted by means of many-body theory considering the interaction deuteron?phonon?deuteron. In fact the phonon exchange produces a attractive component between two deuteron within the D2 molecular. This attractive force is able to reduce the inter-nuclear distance from about 0.7 to 0.16 ?. It means that the lattice strongly modifies the nuclear environment with respect to free space. In this way according to deuterons energy, loading percentage and plasma frequency we are able to predict high o low tunneling probability.",

The MIT isoperibolic calorimetric results published in 1990 had a major impact in convincing scientists, as well as US Patent officials, that the anomalous excess enthalpy reported in 1989 by Fleischmann and Pons in Pd/D systems was due to various calorimetric errors. Additional information about the MIT calorimetry has allowed a more detailed analysis. The major new finding is that the walls of the MIT calorimetric cell were so well insulated with glass wool (2.55 cm thickness) that the major heat transfer pathway was out of the cell top into the room air rather from the cell into the constant temperature water bath. This helps to explain the reported sensitivity of 40mWfor the MIT calorimetry versus the sensitivity of 0.1mWachieved for the Fleischmann-Pons Dewar calorimetry. The evaluation of calorimetric designs, accuracy of temperature measurements, electrolyte level effects, calorimetric equations, and data analysis methods leads to the clear conclusion that the Fleischmann-Pons calorimetry was far superior to that of MIT.

In order to explain the spectra, reaction processes in which three deuterons are involved are considered; sequential reaction and simultaneous three-body reaction.

For the lower energy bombardment, thick target yields for the D+D reactions in Ti were measured down to 4.7 keV.

In an episode which occurred in the spring of 1989, we find the seeds of the disastrous DOE response to cold fusion.

This corresponds to 4.9 ? 10^-15 J/atom D or 1.8 ? 10^4 W/cm^3 Pd. The reason the static pulsed triggering produced more excess heat than other two modes needs to be further studied. The proper ratio in the Pd lattice matching a suitable triggering power may be a key point for heat production.",

We show how most of our predicted transmutation products are consistent with experimental data from a wide variety of LENR experiments, and how they can be triggered. Chemical physics recently discovered a new type of chemical reaction that concentrated most of the energy of reactants into electrons that were originally trapped between reactants. The reaction leaves the reaction product molecule relatively cool. Considering the rules of solid state physics, we apply the pattern of these chemical reactions to nuclear reactions, referred to as \"Lattice Enabled Nuclear Reactions\" (LENR, also called \"Low Energy Nuclear Reactions\"). The predicted nuclear energy release also concentrates the energy in electrons, energized inside the nuclear product. The nuclear products are predicted to be \"cold\", implying non-radioactive, ground state. In some cases the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is sufficient to fracture it into more isotopes that were not originally present. The total attraction energy (coulomb plus nuclear) can overcome the quantum kinetic energy repulsion of the squeezed electron quasi-particles (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) when the effective electron mass exceeds a threshold value. . . .",

Such radiation, however, is not detectable from outside of a standard electrochemical cell due to absorption in the electrolyte and cell walls. A custom cell was therefore assembled which permits X-rays of energy > 1 keV to pass through a thin cathodic membrane and enter into an X-ray detector with minimal attenuation. This test cell geometry also potentially allows any emitted MeV alpha particles to be detected when they impact a Pd cathode and cause fluorescent emission of Pd-K  (21.2, 23.8 keV) X-rays. The detection of X-ray emissions from a membrane electrolytic cell potentially permits the mechanism(s) for anomalous heat production to be investigated with great sensitivity. As an example, a typical X-ray detector allows 1 keV X-rays to be detected at emission rates of less than one per second and this level of sensitivity corresponds to a thermal resolution of < 0.2 fW. Time resolved X-ray spectral data ranging from 1 to 30 keV was collected for over a year using various types of membranes and different electrolytic solutions.

A common element in all these applications is that the electromagnetic energy stored in many relatively slow-moving electrons can, under appropriate circumstances, be collectively transferred into fewer, much faster electrons with energies sufficient for the latter to combine with protons (or deuterons, if present) to produce neutrons through weak interactions. The produced neutrons can then initiate low energy nuclear reactions through further nuclear transmutations. The aim of this paper is to extend and enlarge on various examples analyzed previously, present simplified order-of-magnitude estimates for each and illuminate a common unifying theme among them.

The experiments were performed using a 4.8 mm i.d. stainless steel pressure vessel that can be operated routinely at pressures as high as 400 MPa. In experiments completed to date, reactions between high-purity Pd or Ti and D2 were monitored with: (1) an array of three BF3 neutron detectors, (2) an internal, type-K sample thermocouple, and (3) an internal, type-K reference thermocouple located approximately 10 cm above the sample thermocouple. Using a252Cf source, the efficiency of the BF3 detector array was determined to be approximately 6%. During experimentation, the three neutron detectors were immersed in a water bath thermostated at 27\u00b0C. The neutron count rate, D2 pressure, sample and reference thermocouple readings, and bath temperature were recorded continuously at time intervals ranging from 6 seconds to 10 minutes. Experimental results obtained so far range from negative to potentially significant. No sustained heat production has been observed in any experiment. Thermal pulses that persist briefly after pressurizing Pd with D2 gas are attributable to small amounts of chemical heat released when Pd and D2 react to form palladium deuteride. No sustained neutron flux above background was observed in any Pd-D2 experiment. On the other hand, in a Ti-D2 experiment just completed, potentially significant results were obtained. During this experiment, there was a period of 5 consecutive hours when count rates rose to approximately 60 counts/hour above the average background rate. This detector count rate corresponds nominally to 1000 neutrons/hour emitted from the Ti-D2 sample.

    "abstract": "The simultaneous measurements of power and the rate of evolution of the electrolysis gases in our experiments prove that faradaic efficiencies less than 100% cannot account for our reports of excess heat. Furthermore, our calorimetric results are strikingly similar to reports from other laboratories including measurements in closed calorimetric systems where faradaic efficiencies are not a factor. Excess enthalpy for the Pd/D20 system generally involves high current densities that exceed 100 mA/cm2 ; therefore, the report by S. E. Jones et al. of low faradaic efficiencies using current densities of only 1 to 2 mA/cm2 is not applicable to cold fusion experiments. Based on experiments at our laboratory, there is compelling evidence that the anomalous excess heat is correlated with helium-4 production. For example, 30 out of 33 heat and helium studies yielded either excess helium when excess power was measured or no excess helium when no excess power was present. The probability of obtaining this result by random errors in our heat and helium measurements is very small. Permanent laboratory records always defined the presence or absence of excess power prior to any helium measurement. The measurement of helium in the electrolysis gas samples at three different laboratories places our rate of helium-4 production at 10^11 to 10^12 atoms/s per watt of excess power. This is the correct magnitude for typical deuteron fusion reactions that produce helium-4 as a product.",

Excess heat and weak radiation that assumed to be x-rays and gamma-rays were observed. After the test, almost of the sample and hydrogen gas remains in the same condition they were initially. There are reaction products such as other chemical compounds. However, the formation enthalpies for these compounds are estimated as endothermic. The heat generation sometimes reaches 0.1kW and has continued for several hours. There is a reasonably significant correspondence between the heat generation and the radiation emission. We have confirmed the same result with high reproducibility by controlling temperature and pressure. The anomalous energy generation cannot be the product of a conventional chemical reaction for the following reasons: At these temperatures, hydrogenation reactions are endothermic, not exothermic. The total heat release far exceeded any known chemical reaction with this mass of reactants. There is virtually no chemical fuel in the cell. There were few chemical reaction products. The components and chemical species in the cell including oil and hydrogen gas remained essentially as they were when experiment began, except that the platinum screen was coated with carbon. The emissions are thought that had been generated from some nuclear reaction. The reaction is reliably triggered by raising temperatures above the threshold temperature of ~530?C and the hydrogen pressures above 60 atm. It can be quenched by lowering the temperature inside the cell below ~500?C. When the necessary conditions are achieved, generation of heat is observed with high reproducibility. However, the amount of heat generated is not stable. Only a small amount of reactant is consumed during the experiment, presumably by conventional chemical reactions. We conclude the following: Anomalous heat generation was confirmed during heating of sample in high pressure H2 gas. Sporadic emission was confirmed during high temperature experiment. A weak correlation was observed between heat and the emissions.",

To further investigate this phenomenon, emission during room temperature D-desorption from electrolytically loaded Pd:Dx cathodes was also studied.

Recent simulation analysis results, related to the predicted cluster or cell models of deuterium atoms adsorbed in titanium crystal, together with the related calculations by Coulomb formula and Yukawa formula were investigated. Coulomb force working between deuteron?deuteron (d?d) particles is compared with the nuclear force working between them. The change of the force to each of them is evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of the atomic nucleus. Taking into account the results of previous studies, it seems that nuclear fusion will occur occasionally without adding any specified energy. We think that there is a possibility of a collision of free deuterons through the medium of a negative charge in a deuterium atom in ligancy 2. On the other hand, we think that if a suitable amount of energy, which is far smaller than that of high temperature nuclear fusion, such as the irradiation of the alternative electromagnetic wave, for example, is supplied to adsorbed deuterium atoms and desorbed deuterons in the titanium (Ti) shavings packed in the experimental cylinder under a pressurized or evacuation condition with a suitable temperature rise, then there also will be a higher probability of nuclear fusion being achieved.",

Instead we suggest that CF is the result of phenomena that are most intense at absolute temperature T equal to zero, and that these effects persist at room temperature. This alternative approach makes good physical sense because it is unreasonable to believe that particle-particle collisions can provide a mechanism for overcoming the conventional \"Coulomb B arrier\" at room temperature as many have assumed (Lindley, 1 990; Chechin et aI, 1 994). Instead, we suggest that the possible avenues to fusion are the result of coherent, many-body effects that are tied to the underlying, well-known rules of solid-state physics as they apply to periodically ordered lattices. In the paper, we provide an overview of the logic associated with this alternative framework and suggest a number of new , lower T experiments in which pronounced anomalous behavior could result from D+D->4He reactions.",

A clear peak at 3.2 MeV was observed, when a pre-loading TiDx was applied. This peak became evidently, following the implantation dose.

This ratio was much higher than prediction value based on the secondary reaction of D-D fusion. Some unknown high energy counts located from 3.5 MeV to 17 MeV in charged particle spectra has been observed for many times.

Completely new experiments have produced even larger excess power effects for this deuterated co-deposition system. The largest excess power effect in D2O produced 1.7Wor about 13 W/g of palladium (160 W/cm3). These large excess power effects were absent in extensive studies of H2O controls. Excess power was also absent in various experiments involving the co-deposition of ruthenium (Ru), rhenium (Re), and nickel (Ni) in both H2O and D2O ammonia solutions. The statistical analysis of all 18 co-deposition experiments yields a probability of greater than 99.9989 % that the co-deposition excess power effect requires both palladium metal and D2O. Shuttle reactions have been proposed to explain the reproducible excess power effect in this ammonia co-deposition system. However, various electrochemical studies show no evidence for any shuttle reactions in this ammonia system. Nevertheless, the initial chemistry for the Pd system is complex leading to large pH changes, chlorine (Cl2) evolution, and the formation of nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) during the first few days. However, the large excess power effects are observed later in the experiments after this chemistry is completed. A better understanding of the chemistry should be helpful in the reproduction of anomalous excess power in co-deposition systems.",

In order to reach such an high value of X, extensive use of electrolysis of heavy water with a Pd cathode has been made.The present experiment is aimed at obtaining high loading ratios of deuterium in palladiumwithout using electrolysis. The idea is to have deuterium gas in contact with palladium. The use of low temperatures has the purpose of increasing the equilibrium loading ratio for a given gas pressure.A first test experiment, performed at ENEA Frascati in 2002, showed that it was possible to have D/Pd ratios as high as 1 at 150 K with a pressure lower than 1 bar [1].

Kervran (1901-1983), a medical scientist and engineer with a high official position in the French research and occupational health community, had a life-long interest in the possibility of biological transmutations. His curiosity apparently began in his youth when he watched the hens pecking at specks of mica in the farmyard. His later professional observations concerned (in one small part) the anomalous reappearance of robust calcium-bearing eggshells in calcium-deprived chickens that had been administered dietary mica (a potassium-rich mineral). Over a century earlier (in 1799), French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin had noted this. The Kervran bio-transmutation story and its background is summarized eloquently in \"Alchemists in the Garden,\" a chapter of the best-selling book The Secret Life of Plants by Peter Tompkins and the late Christopher Bird.",

This result corresponds to a volume excess power of 8.75 W /cm^3 Pd or a surface excess power of 0.044 W /cm^2 Pd, and a specific excess heat of 2.48 MJ/cm^3 Pd or 228 eV/atom Pd. The current density and D/Pd ratio for excess power production were lower than the recognized ?threshold' values 100-150 mA/cm^2 and 0.83-0.92 D/Pd, this indicates that the critical requirement for reproduction of the anomalous heat can be ?cut down' using high sensitivity calorimetry. By comparison with that of the Pd/D2O system, no anomalous excess heat was measured in the Pd/H2O electrolytic system within the experimental uncertainty.",

In the present study, a numerical model is used to simulate the anomalous nuclear products according to the fission interpretation. Specifically, the reactions were simulated by means of a nuclear lattice model assuming that nucleons are ordered in an antiferromagnetic face-centered-cubic (fcc) array. The simulations indicate that small and middle-sized nuclei can be fractured along weakly bound planes of the lattice structure. It is argued that the simulations provide theoretical support for the experimentally-observed reactions and, moreover, that the probabilities calculated for various low-energy fissions can be used to explain the stepwise changes in the element abundances of the Earth?s crust, evolved from basaltic to sialic composition over geological time.",

The trajectories of the particles were calculated by numerically solving a system of differential equations of mechanics. Relativistic equations were used, and the interaction of particles was considered Coulombic without taking into account magnetic effects. About 104 stories were modeled, each of them containing up to 100 collisions of free electrons with a hydrogen atom. The total number of simulated atoms that experienced collisions was ~ 10^6. Dynamic modeling revealed the formation of neutral particles consisting of protons (deuterons) with an electron rotating around them in nonstationary, close to elliptical orbits with an apogee to a distance of less than 10^-11 cm and to a perigee of ~ 10^-12 cm. These particles, which are continuously changing in size and shape, are up to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than ordinary hydrogen atoms, and 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than neutrons. Such nonstationary hydrogen miniatoms can exist for a short time (on our estimate, up to ~ 10^-12 sec.) in the environment of free electrons of metals, easily move in them and, like neutrons, approach the nuclei of isotopes of hydrogen or other elements at a distance at which nuclear fusion reactions or transmutation of elements are possible due to the tunneling effect. Taking into account the formation of such hydrogen miniatoms the previously calculated rate of low-energy nuclear reactions in metals1^-6 increases more than by 5 ? 6 orders of magnitude, that is, to values corresponding to experimental data. Formation of hydrogen miniatoms in the medium of free electrons is of primary importance in the mechanism of low-energy nuclear reactions.",

    "abstract": "On May 20, 2017, we started a series of experiments with the goal of observing vibrationally induced excitation transfer of the 14.4 keV nuclear state from excited Fe-57 to ground state Fe-57 nuclei. A steel plate with a Co-57 substrate on the front surface was vibrated by a piezoelectric transducer near 2.21 MHz; and emission in the X-ray region was recorded with an Amptek X-123 detector on the front side, a scintillator/photomultiplier detector on the back side, and a Geiger counter on the back side. The experiments provided a negative result for the originally sought ultrasonically induced excitation transfer effect, but instead showed non-exponential time histories for photon counts on all three detectors. Specifically, increased emission of the 14.4 keV gamma, Fe K-alpha and K-beta X-rays was observed at early time. This enhancement was present at the start of the experiments at about 19% above expected levels for the 14.4 keV gamma, and about 17% for the Fe K-alpha, with the enhancement decaying away with a time constant of about 2.5 days. Emission on the Sn K-alpha was consistent with the expected exponential decay of Co-57 at the 1% level. Non-exponential decay with an enhancement at early time was also seen for the weak Fe K-alpha escape peak, and in the backside Geiger counter data; and a reduction at early times was seen on the higher energy channels of the scintillator/photomultiplier detector counter both looking at the back side. The observed non-exponential decay is connected with the tightening of bolts on wooden clamps on the corners of the steel plate, which apply mechanical stress to the sample. Candidate interpretations are considered, in which the stress induced in the steel results in scattering and generation of THz phonons by dislocations, and in which phonon?nuclear coupling mediated by THz phonons leads to the transfer of nuclear excitation to other nuclei (\"excitation transfer\"), which can cause spatial delocalization of the source and angular anisotropy of the photon emission.",

This suggests that a better approach should be to focus on experiments in which Pd codeposition is controlled, such as in the Szpak experiment. Unfortunately, the Szpak experiment has proven difficult to replicate, and we conjecture that this is due to low D/Pd loading. A modified protocol has been tested in which codeposition is carried out at higher current density with a lower PdCl2 concentration.

Because of the many-body nature of the interactions of room-temperature deuterons diffusing through a lattice possessing deuterons in many of the interstitial positions, the diffusing deuterons can resonate on the atomic scale in the potential wells bounded by the ascending walls of adjacent Coulomb barriers and thereby penetrate the CouIomb barriers in a fashion vastly underestimated by two-body calculations in which wells for possible resonance are absent. Indeed, perhaps the lack of robust reproducibility in cold fusion originates from the narrowness of such transmission resonances",

The most novel analytical techniques are terahertz (THz) imaging and THz spectroscopy. This imaging technique gives insight into the lattice spacing of crystalline and micro-crystalline metals and ceramics complimentary to that from X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. XRD of powder removed from this sample showed the normal lattice spacing for pure Ni powder. However, THz imaging showed lattice dilation in the Ni coating. We discuss the potential source of this dilation as well as its possible importance to LENR. We will also discuss the results of THz spectroscopy performed on materials from this and similar tubes This report discusses metallurgical and physical measurements, such as optical microscopy, density and porosity measurements, terahertz (THz) imaging and spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We also cover chemical and elemental measurements such as energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP- OES), ICP-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and He mass spectroscopy. With the latter method we present an intriguing result that shows tritium production in a unique Pd electrolysis experiment. EDX, ICP-OES, and ICP-MS can help the researcher understand the role of minor and major elemental impurities in these materials. If present, ICP-MS may also detect isotopic anomalies in these materials post experiment.

A very specific process involving intense charging and discharging of deuterium from the palladium cathode during continuous electrolysis of heavy water, called the \u201con-off effect,\u201d was discovered. This effect is 10 to 100 times stronger than the ordinary on-off effect of the current.

It is concluded that the particular characteristics of palladium and the generation of a huge inner pressure within the palladium are necessary conditions for a cold fusion reaction.\n\nOther researchers have used a much smaller palladium cathode than the one used here. They measured only the electrolysis temperature, and not the cathode temperature. Thus, their experiments failed to discover the thermal characteristics of the palladium cathode, the on-off effect, and intense cold fusion.

This is indirect proof that exceptionally high temperatures have been achieved. (Direct measurement of the reaction temperature has proved difficult.)

The authors have sought a different approach, wherein the device has no input energy, relying on the energy produced by cold fusion in the device. The device consists of diodes fabricated as powder, with a large surface junction made up of a semiconductor in contact with palladium charged with deuterium.The apparent fusion reactions take place in the junction between the semiconductor and the Palladium powder, which produces an excitation which is transmitted to the electrons. This excitation increases their energy and allows them to cross the bandgap of the semiconductor and pass into the conduction band, as in a photovoltaic cell. This energy very quickly appears as a spontaneous potential difference which can reach over 0.5 volt per junction.The potential drop concentrates on the junction region, and at a nano scale the electric field reaches considerable values, higher than the megavolt per meter, which constrains the deuterium nuclei and increases the probability of deuterium fusion.",

If hydrogen should be considered an energy storage medium rather than a natural resource. However, free hydrogen does not exist on earth. Many techniques for obtaining hydrogen have been proposed. It can be reformulated from conventional hydrocarbon fuels, or obtained directly from water by electrolysis or high-temperature pyrolysis with a heat source such as a nuclear reactor. However, the efficiencies of these methods are low. The direct heating of water to sufficiently high temperatures for sustaining pyrolysis is very difficult. Pyrolysis occurs when the temperature exceeds 4000?C. Thus plasma electrolysis may be a better alternative, it is not only easier to achieve than direct heating, but also appears to produce more hydrogen than ordinary electrolysis, as predicted by Faraday?s laws, which is indirect evidence that it produces very high temperatures. We also observed large amounts of free oxygen generated at the cathode, which is further evidence of direct decomposition, rather than electrolytic decomposition. To achieve the continuous generation of hydrogen with efficiencies exceeding Faraday efficiency, it is necessary to control the surface conditions of the electrode, plasma electrolysis temperature, current density and input voltage. The minimum input voltage required induce the plasma state depends on the density and temperature of the solution, it was estimated as 120V in this study. The lowest electrolyte temperature at which plasma forms is ~75?C. We have observed as much as 80 times more hydrogen generated by plasma electrolysis than by conventional electrolysis at 300 V.",

The neutron emissions were time correlated with SL light emission. The gamma ray emissions were delayed as would be expected from neutron slowing down and capture. Control experiments with normal acetone did not result in tritium activity nor neutron emissions. Fusion was observed during experiments in which the nanoscale nucleation of bubbles were induced in chilled deuterated acetone using a pulse neutron generator as well as with an isotope neutron source. Video images clearly indicate the existinence of complex bubble clusters when bubble fusion occurs, and also the formation of comet-like structures which were detrimental to bubble nuclear fusion. Hydrodynamic shock code simulations have supported the experimental findings and indicate temperatures during implosion in the 108K range along with Gbar shock pressures in the imploding bubbles within bubble clusters, but not in single bubble environments.

Further, in this paper, we have taken the interaction between deuteron-optical photons, we want to clarify this point, of course, these photons have a vibrational frequency of interest because it was discovered that the interaction between photons and deuterons causes the Coulomb barrier is not static, that has of oscillations in different directions within the lattice. So we can conclude that this phenomenon of cold fusion that breaks new ground in modern nuclear physics. In recent years, over 20 years, have seen thousands of experiments and theoretical models to explain the phenomenon of fusion at low energy (LENR) in specialized heavy hydrogen systems. We can say that a new possible way to obtain nuclear energy without waste is emerging. Nevertheless in spite of experimental contributions, the theoretical framework is not known. In this work, we try to explain the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of the coherence theory of nuclear and condensed matter. The coherence model of condensed matter affirms that within a deuteron-loaded palladium lattice there are three different plasmas: electrons, ions and deuterons plasma. Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can take place on the octahedrical sites or in the tetrahedral in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called ?-plasma the deuterons plasma in the octahedral site and ? -plasma which in tetrahedral. We propose a general model of effective local time-dependent deuteron-deuteron potential, that takes into account the electrons and ions plasma oscillations. The main features of this potential are extracted by means of many-body theory considering the interaction deuteron-phonon-deuteron. In fact the phonon exchange produces a attractive component between two deuteron within the D2 molecular. This attractive force is able to reduce the inter-nuclear distance from about 0.7 to 0.16 ?. It means that the lattice strongly modifies the nuclear environment with respect to free space. In this way according to deuterons energy, loading percentage and plasma frequency we are able to predict high o low tunneling probability. The fusion rates (s-1) computed vary from 10^-70 to 10^-17 and also a set of other mechanism, which could be enhanced these values, are proposed. In this way we hope that by means of this approach in the future will be possible to realize and control the nuclear exothermic reactions that take place in the condensed matter in order to obtain clean energy.",

This TSO-perspective further hints at nuclear reactions of a 'centripetal' kind different from those based on 'translational collisions', described by present high energy physics.

Coulometric measurements during both the hydrogen deposition and subsequent removal steps have shown that H:Pd ratios of 0.7 are reached under these conditions, in accord with accepted values for bulk samples. The frequency decrease observed at AT-cut crystals during hydrogen (deuterium) loading is larger than that expected for the mass of hydrogen deposited into the film. Considering that palladium undergoes a substantial increase in volume upon hydrogen uptake, the role of the resulting film stress in influencing the observed frequency must be addressed. It has been found that such film stresses at an AT-cut crystal produce frequency decreases and that these effects can be accounted for using techniques which are well established in the frequency control field. Measurements at BT-cut crystals, the stress/frequency response of which is opposite to that of AT-cut crystals, have confirmed that stress plays a major role in the present work and have allowed the determination of a quantitative value for this stress.

By examining the electromagnetic energies and forces, many questions about nuclear behavior can be answered, and many insights into the atomic nucleus can be gained. Previous theoretical models for the Nuclear Force include only the Coulomb electric force of the protons, but with little or no consideration of the electromagnetic characteristics of the quarks. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve predictions of binding energy better than any previous model, doing so by using only one parameter instead of the five parameters used in the semi-empirical Weizs?cker formula of the Liquid Drop Model. The Electromagnetic Model unifies the Nuclear Force to the Electromagnetic Force. The Electromagnetic Model of the Nuclear Force includes the calculation of electromagnetics of the quarks, and by doing such, it is shown that the Nuclear Force is significantly influenced by the Electromagnetic Forces of the quarks. This paper, Part II of this series, illustrates the ground state configurations of the atomic nuclei, showing the basic segments of how the protons and neutrons cluster together, and how these segments bond to form larger atomic nuclei. A pattern emerges for the ground state configurations due to the uniformity of the electromagnetic laws. Diagrams are shown for this basic pattern, for both stable and radioactive atomic nuclei. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve not only excellent predictions of binding energy, but the ability to answer many other questions regarding the various behaviors of atomic nuclei.",

Triple deuterium interaction could perhaps be possible in the 0.5-1.0 angstrom range; the distance between D's in a D2  molecule are 0.74 angstrom. The hypothesis accounts for the low reproducibility and short duration of the effect because of rapid destruction of the active structure by sputtering, radiation damage, bubble formation and chemical reduction of the impurities to compounds like D2O, ND3, CD4, or BD3.

Power levels exceeding 200 watts over a 20 hour period have been observed, although this large thermal response was obtained in only 4 out of 16 experiment runs, each using a new Pd cathode and electrolyte solution. In most cases, thermal power began after loading the Pd films followed by temperature cycling of the cell from room temperature to near 60 ?C. However one run showed a large thermal output without electrolytic loading of the cathode, indicating the possibility of a catalyzed chemical reaction between the electrolyte, the Pd cathode and Pt anode, and the air cover over the cell. Indeed all power producing runs were accompanied by a precipitated formation oflithium carbonate, indicating a strong coupling of the reaction with CO2 in the air.",

The model yields results that are well within the experimental error.

    "abstract": "High D/Pd loading is known to be a requirement for producing excess heat in the Fleischmann?Pons experiment, and much work has in recent years been focused on electrochemical protocols and cathode processing in order to achieve D/Pd loadings approaching unity routinely. However, we know very little about PdD at a loading near unity, and almost nothing about what happens when the loading exceeds unity. It may be that when the octahedral sites are fully occupied, additional interstitial deuterium atoms occupy tetrahedral sites, a proposal which at this point has little experimental support. It is nevertheless possible to construct an empirical model for this scenario, and to make use of available experimental data to fit the associated model parameters. We worked with empirical models for both PdD and PdH that assume an O-site energy quadratic in loading, and an O-site to T-site excitation which is either constant in loading, or else taken as an empirical function fit to estimates inferred from the analysis of experimental data. There are two empirical models, each with four or more free parameters; and insufficient experimental data from which to choose each parameter or function independently. We add supplementary constraints that presume the models for PdH and PdD must be very similar, which reduces the number of degrees of freedom within the models. This allows data from PdH to be used to construct a model for PdD, and vice versa. The models which result are interesting; they suggest these complicated systems might be understood based on a simple underlying picture; they indicate that there is more T-site occupation than has been appreciated previously in the literature; they indicate that the resistance ratio calibrations for PdH and PdD are inconsistent; and finally, measurements of the chemical potential at high loading have the potential to provide information about the O-site to T-site excitation energy.",

These include experimental evidence for very high virtual pressures under certain conditions, and the influence of promotors and surface blockers. Dislocation generation and motion can result from the large stresses accompanying composition gradients and phase transformations. Because of preferential segregation of interstitial species to dislocations, transport along dislocations can be much faster than through the bulk crystal, and dislocation motion can cause unusually rapid interstitial solute transport and both entry and emission from surfaces. Mechanical effects related to the presence of hydrogen often are sporadic and can have long delay times. It is possible that some of the same microstructural features and phenomena that are responsible for delayed mechanical behavior play an important role in the \"solid state fusion\" observations.

The limiting current continues for a few volts to a few hundred volts, depending on the metal. a glow develops at the electrode and becomes continuous at the end of the plateau, where the cd increases irregularly(breakdown). The breakdown potential does not depend on the field in the water. It occurs at about the same cd for most metals. When electrolytes are added, the cell potential at the breakdown is increased. Adsorbed layers and organic coatings increase the breakdown potential. Electrical energy storage in water is increased by ~10 times by coatings. The breakdown potential decreases with increase of the log of rate constant for H evolution on the various electrodes and with corresponding work function. The cell potentials for breakdown correspond to fields in the dielectric below that needed to dissociate it. The limiting current is caused by the formation of a H2-steam layer at the interface, which causes increase in the electrode potential at constant current. The H2-steam layer plasmolyzes. When the Fermi level in the cathode reaches the conduction band of water, electrons enter the water and remain stable therein. They interact nonadiabatically with water and are .the head of streamers.

At the level of nuclear \"modeling\", the lattice is rather successful at reproducing the major features of the historical models. To wit, the binding energies and nuclear radii predictions of the liquid-drop model [LDM] are reproduced in a close-packed lattice because the lattice is dominated by near-neighbor, two-body, nucleon-nucleon interactions, as in the LDM. The alpha particle substructure of nuclei, as postulated in the cluster models, is reproduced in a nucleon lattice with spin- and isospin-layering because a close-packed lattice inherently contains He4-like, tetrahedral nucleon clusters. Most importantly, the shells, subshells and \"magic\" numbers of the independent-particle model [IPM] are reproduced in the lattice on a purely geometrical basis ? a direct consequence of nucleon build-up from a central tetrahedron. That fact was noted (and illustrated in Physical Review!) by Eugene Wigner in 1937 ? who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics explicitly \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus [...], particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\". It is noteworthy that the exact same lattice described by Wigner achieves unification of the modern-day nuclear models using a realistic, short-range, nuclear potential ? and not the purely-theoretical, quark-based fiction of a long-range, nuclear \"mean field.\"Models of the Atomic Nucleus goes beyond the traditional concerns of nuclear modeling in addressing the still-unexplained topics of the fragment asymmetry in fission, the millisecond instability of the so-called super-heavy nuclei, and the remarkable findings of transmutation of elements in low-energy nuclear reaction [LENR] studies.

    "abstract": "Plausible mechanisms are discussed for explaining the sudden burst of energy released from 0.85MEpsom (MgSO4?7H2O) aqueous solution following sodium metal dissolution which led to the vaporization of the entire system including the glass beaker. Exothermic reactions lead to micro/nano-metastable crystal formation due to steam cavitation. H + 2 molecular ions trapped at Mg2+ ion lattice sites in cavitation-induced metastable crystals were considered as precursors for energy release. In principle, for charge compensation, two protons should occupy one Mg2+ lattice site in these crystals. Therefore, cavitation crystal formation brings in the two protons in molecular ions closer. This process is, however, opposed by Coulombic repulsion between the two protons which results in the collapse of the nanocrystal containing hydrogen. This leads to the release of hydrogen ions into the solution resulting in the release of hydration energy during the formation of H3O+, hydronium ions and in local heating. Stirring distributes the heat energy uniformly in the solution. Local heating, however, leads to the promotion of cavitation - this time with more vigor since additional energy input has occurred. Thus reformation of the crystal takes place quickly and the hydrogen ions are brought together more closer than during the previous occasion which increases the electrostatic repulsive force. As a result, the crystal collapses faster leading to the release of more hydration energy. This is how cavitation gains energy from repulsion. The above cavitation Coulombic repulsion oscillation (CCRO) cycle continues leading to an exponential build-up of the pressure and oscillation speed of the precursors and a decrease in inter-proton separation leading to their collision. Finally a sudden burst of energy witnessed occurs due to cavitation collapse. It remains to be ascertained if the energy release is a consequence of p-p fusion, or other mechanisms proposed which include volume casimir effect, miniature black holes and lattice phonon amplification. The fact that increase in the oscillation speed of the two protons in the proposed H + 2 species is exponential without an upper limit till the end-point is reached should determine the logistics of the underlying mechanism causing the energy release. The p-p fusion should, however, be accompanied by positron emission whose presence could be verified by its annihilation gamma rays or with 5.5 MeV gamma rays produced from HD fusion reactions if energetic deuterium is formed from p-p fusion in amounts commensurate with the energy produced but this fusion process is mediated by weak interaction process and hence is less probable.

The extra fusion energy is immediately carried away by a macroscopic amount of deuterons.

    "abstract": "In heavily hydrogenated (deuterated) palladium crystals, the crystallinity is degraded. This non-uniformity results in phonon modes that are localized and of higher frequency than for unloaded lattices. These modes create dynamic electrostatic fields that couple strongly with both bound and free electrons and the hydrogen (H and D) sub-lattice. A consequent potential inversion leads to the formation of \"lochons\" (local-charged bosons-electron pairs in the singlet state) and results in H- or D- ions in the sub-lattice. The nuclear-Coulomb repulsion between colliding D+ D- ion pairs in the sub-lattice is considerably reduced by the resultant \"strong screening\" and \"lochon-drag\" effects. Furthermore, work is done, by the bound lochon in a D- ion attracting an adjacent D+ ion. This results in reductions: of the deuteron?s electron-orbital radii, as the ion pair approaches; of the mass deficit between the deuteron pair and a 4He atom (or a proton pair and a 2He/2H atom); and finally of the Coulomb repulsion between nuclear protons in a helium nucleus. Thus, the end product of such a deuteron-pair fusion is an excited-helium nucleus (4He*) with lower energy relative to that resulting from energetic deuteron collisions. This reduced energy of the excited nucleus may be lower than its new fragmentation levels. The effect of lochon mediation, to alter the nuclear potential-well and fragmentation energies, allows decay to the 4He ground states to be free of particulate radiation. This decay process, of \"neutral\" 2He (from p+p) or 4He excited nuclei, is also a basis for observed transmutation.",

The thickness of the metal was about one millimeter. In the first of a number of experiments positive indications of fusion were observed but these could not be repeated in subsequent experiments. The inability to repeat results has been found to occur in other cold fusion experiments and signifies that the processes involved are not understood (1). Since 1990, a number of results have been obtained which may put these earlier failures in a new light. In particular, the discovery by Miles (2), who reported positive results during electrolysis from 6mm thick rod after failure with Pd electrodes one mm thick. This introduces the bulk of the metal as a possible factor in the occurrence of cold fusion. Another noticeable feature of the absorption of deuterium in Pd is the obvious signs of cold work done on the metal. The surface is roughened, cracks appear and measurements show an apparent 15% increase in volume.

If this mechanism induces the formation of D- D+ pairs, the tightly bound and energetic electron pair (a \"lochon\" in the D- ion) becomes an attractive force between the nuclei. The lattice constraints and slow collision processes force the ions into a near 1-D configuration within the lattice that deepens the electron ground-state potential well. This permits the electron pair to remain closely bound to one deuteron and to do work in bringing the D- D+ pair together. The work done reduces the nuclear-mass deficit (transferring it to electron kinetic and field energy) and that, along with the reduced Coulomb repulsion of the nuclear protons, brings down the helium nuclear-energy levels of the fusing pair and raises the 4He fragmentation level. The proposed model accounts for the observations in condensed-matter nuclear science (CMNS) of excess heat (in both p-p andd-d reactions) and the differing observations (or for the absence) of tritium, 3He, neutrons, and 4He. The variation (unpredictability) of results (inherent in the many experiments) and evidence for transmutation, heretofore stumbling blocks to acceptability of CMNS, is now perhaps a validation of its existence.

So we considered the works of Maly and Va?vra on the topic, the most complete solution available and one showing an infinite family of EDO solutions. In particular, we deeply analyzed their second of these papers, where they consider a finite nucleus and look for solutions with a Coulomb potential modified inside the nucleus. In the present paper, we quickly recall our analysis, verification, and extension of their results. Moreover, we answer to a recent criticism that the EDOs would represent negative energy states and therefore would not qualify as an answer to the questions posed by Cold Fusion results. We can prove, by means of a simple algebraic argument based on the solution process, that, while at the transition region, the energy of the EDOs are positive. Next, we deepen the essential role of Special Relativity as source of the EDOs, which we discussed in previous papers. But the central topic of our present study is an initial analysis of the magnetic interactions near the nucleus, with the aim of solving important physical questions: do the EDOs satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty relation (HUR)? Are the orbits stable? So, we examine some works related to the Vigier?Barut Model, with potentials including magnetic coupling. We also carried out approximate computations to evaluate the strength of these interactions and the possibilities of their answering some of our questions. As a first result, we can expect the HUR to be respected by EDOs, due to the high energies of the magnetic interactions near the nucleus. Present computations for stability do not yet give a plain result; we need further studies and tools based on QED to face the complexity of the near-nuclear region. For the creation of EDOs, we outline a possibility based on magnetic coupling.",

    "abstract": "Tesla and Tandberg in their already old works have first discovered generation of very short and powerfol bursts of electric current with an absolutely unknown nature under some certain conditions of a gas discharge on direct current. One did not pay any serious attention to that phenomenon. And only in the recent works of Paulo and Alexandra Correa it was shown that by creation of the conditions for abnormal gas discharge (PAGD - Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharge) on direct current powerful bursts of alternating current appear. The energy of these bursts exceeds several times the consumed energy (up to 10 times). In this experiment one can observe that a part of electric current carriers (obviously electrons) gain high velocities being the reason for excess energy generation. According to the unitary quantum theory it possible to explain easily the generation of excess energy [1, 7, 8]. The electrons can oscillate with a high plasma frequency relatively to very heavy positive ions. Their behaviour is possible to explain as oscillations in a potential well with the rims of various height. A t some certain values of initial phase the approximate equation of the unitary quantum theory with an oscillating charge can yield the \"mathernily home\" solution [1,7,8]. As a result of the electrones having gained a high energy with a high velosity they fly out of the wells, and always in one direction. It is the energy generation process - and not nuclear reactions - that are responsible for excess energy creation. The mathematical process model is created as well as an approximate solution of the non-linear difforential equation is achieved. The range of values of initial phases allowing the energy generation process is determined. If the experimental research of Tesla, Tandberg and Correa are correct then there is no doubt the foture power industry would be developing in this direction and not in today's fashionable direction of the cold nuclear fusion.",

Upon the suggestion of the Conference Organizers, we added a detailed explanation of our procedures; moreover, we included the latest results and data from our recently published papers. In the framework of LENR-AHE (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction - Anomalous Heat Effects) studies, since 2021, we have been focused on innovative, low-cost materials instead of the usual, precious metal palladium. We found that the Cu-Ni alloy, known as Constantan (also used for J-type thermocouple construction), has the peculiarity of being able to easily dissociate H2 (or D2) from molecularto an atomic state. While the catalytic feature appears at a rather low temperature (150 ?C), Constantan is also able to store atomic hydrogen within its lattice and/or at surfaces, up to temperature of 700-800 ?C, and in a wide range of pressures. Thanks to our long experience (since 1994) with wires, we designed various experiments that take advantage of such specific shapes, namely in terms of electromigration of absorbed and adsorbed H, under a suitable longitudinal electric field (0.4-2.5 V/cm), DC and/or pulsed. In 1995 we got noticeable results using Pd wires in electrolytic environments (D2O) at mild temperatures (40-60 ?C). Later on, in some experiments, we used even gaseous environments at high temperatures (up to 700-800 ?C). . . .",

Following Mizuno?s procedures, we fabricated nano-structured material composed of Pd and Ni by glow discharge on a heater located in the center of a vacuum chamber. The nano-structured Pd/Ni was prepared with D2 before use. Then, we applied electrical power to the heater that was covered with the nano-structured Pd/Ni while evacuating the chamber, and we observed the heater temperature behavior. Next, we introduced D2 gas at about 250 Pa to the chamber while maintaining the heater input. As a result, in three experiments, we observed that heater temperature increases compared to the reference experiment (with no nano-structured Pd/Ni). In particular, in experiments with 7 W input, we observed a123?C heater temperature increase compared to the reference experiment. It can be said that we replicated Mizuno?s experiment successfully. Since the heater was covered with nano-structured material, there was a concern that a change in emissivity affected the heater temperature measurement. Numerical calculation was conducted to evaluate the effect of the change of the surface emissivity. It was concluded that even if the emissivity drop dramatically from 0.7 to 0.3 due to the coating of the nano-structured Pd/Ni, the temperature rise would be only 70?C at the most. The postulated emissivity change cannot explain the observed temperature increase of 123?C. These experimental and numerical results suggest that anomalous excess heat was generated by the interaction between nano-structured Pd/Ni surface and D2 gas.",

    "abstract": "ICCF16 marks nearly 22 years of research into the phenomenon first called \"cold fusion\". This newfield has expanded in breadth to the point that numerous acronyms compete to describe overlapping effects. Two of these are: LENR(LowEnergy Nuclear Reactions) and its subset FPE (the Fleischmann Pons Effect). Research to elucidate the basic processes and shed light on mechanisms has proceeded effectively continuously since March 1989 at SRI and elsewhere, and diligently and as \"time and funds\" have allowed at numerous other accomplished institutions worldwide. It is now clear to a well-informed but relatively small group of scientifically interested individuals that the deuterium-palladium systems conceals a heat source with energy exceeding by several orders of magnitude mechanical, lattice storage or chemical energy effects. Evidences of possible dd fusion products have been widely and numerously observed, at least partially ratifying the original speculative designation of \"cold fusion\". The effect, however, is apparently not limited to deuterium as a fuel, to helium as a product or to palladium as a matrix, hence the classification of the field as Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) to differentiate these \"new\" effects from those observed in the rarified environments of particle and plasma physics. The materials-related issues associated with the so-called irreproducibility of CMNS effects presents the greatest barrier to the advancement and acceptance of the field. Precisely because we are dealing with condensed matter, micro-structural and micro-impurity control is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized equipment, control and skill. Problems of similar scale (and origin) have been faced and overcome in the past in the development of technologies having similar significance for mankind. Two (of many) examples are: the development of solid-state semiconductors; implementation of conventional nuclear power (and weapons). Absent another Bell Labs or Manhattan Project how should the CMNS field best proceed? Several overlapping options will be discussed. It is well within the capability of \"mainstream\" scientists and engineers in academia, and in national and private laboratories to resolve the materials issues and the questions of whether or not specific products are or are not present. Without funding they will not be encouraged to do so; without (a higher degree of) acceptance, adequate funding will not be made available.

The differences between the application of these two kind beams were obtained by comparing the radiation yields of X-ray, gamma-ray, charged particle and neutron induced by each deuteron of two kinds of beam at the same velocity. The fusion rate induced by each cluster-deuteron in the energy region below 40 keV/d was higher than that induced by each isolated deuteron at the same velocity. However the fusion rate induced by each cluster-deuteron was less in the energy region above 50 keV/d. Ratio of the fusion rate induced by each cluster deuteron to that induced by each isolated deuteron was energy dependent. The yield of X-ray induced by each cluster deuteron in the energy region from 10 keV/d to 100 keV/d was higher than that induced by each isolated deuteron at the same velocity. The average ratio of their X-ray yields is about 2.6. Based on above results, it is considered there might be an enhancement of interaction cross-section in both nuclear and atomic levels in lower energy region. If the size of cluster ion is grown, the enhancement might be increased more.

Endothermic element synthesis in Pd. and/or Ni layers due to high proton concentration, in analogy to stellar synthesis can be seen from the generation of very rare elements such as terbium. A convincing explanation is necessary. It was concluded phenomenologically that the reaction of the protons or deuterons by fusion or with the nuclei of the host metal occurs at a distance of about picometers with a reaction time of about megaseconds. It was noted that the Bohr radius rB of hydrogen atoms in a dielectric with refractive index n is changed to rBn2. such that with the electron concentration of the host metals a plasma refractive index of 0.076 results in a value of 3pm. In order to understand the subsequent dielectric modification of the ionization energy, we apply the model of depression of this energy by the Inglis-Teller effect for which a model with the best agreement with plasma experiments was presented before. For our model of the dielectrically shrunk picometer hydrogen atoms, the low ionization energies result in a reasonable relation between dielectric properties and the effective Debye length. Preference of the reaction at surfaces or interfaces between different host metals are due to the same reduction of the dielectric response as observed with surface plasmons.

Surface segregation was observed in samples that were essentially \u03b1-phase materials,i.e., high-purity commercial \u03b1-Ti, Ti-6A1, and Ti-3A1-2.5V, whereas Ti-6A1-4V had slight enrichment and \u03b2-Ti-13Mn had no detectable segregation. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) techniques were used to measure the near-surface deuterium concentration, and the segregation has been localized to within 50 nm of the surface. The time-dependent increase of deuterium at the surface is consistent with deuterium diffusion from the bulk to the surface and a room-temperature diffusivity of approximately 3 \u00d7 10-9 cm2/s. Surface enrichment in excess of 30 times the bulk concentration was observed in charged samples and in excess of 60 times for samples that had been charged and then vacuum annealed. Polishing was found to be of importance in causing segregation. The presence of deuterides or a surface defect state is suggested to explain the deuterium surface enrichment.",

It is found that ADCs differ from the diffusion coefficient under stress-free conditions when either the initial concentration or the chemopotential-step (or flux-step) is taken to be a nonzero value. At the same time, effects of other parameters on values of ADC are discussed as well. The theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data. Our results indicate that a small current will give the minimum error in determining the diffusion coefficient while the initial hydrogen content is nonzero.",

In experiments with Pd cathode samples in D2 GD, the recorded excess heat power amounted to 10 - 15 W and the estimated efficiency (the output thermal power in relation to the input electric power) was up to 130%. Excess heat power up to 5 W, and efficiency up to 150% was recorded for deuterium precharged Pd cathode samples in Xe and Kr discharges. Production of impurity nuclides with atomic masses less than and more than that of the cathode material was registered. Considerable deviation from the natural isotopic ratio was observed for the registered elemental impurities. X-ray emission was measured in H2, D2 , Ar, Xe and Kr GD during the GD operation and after the GD current switch off (up to several hours afterwards) with the help of thermo-luminescent detectors (TLD), X-ray film and scintillator detectors with photomultipliers. The recorded energetic spectra of X-ray emission range 0.5 - 10 keV. Weak gamma-emission (up to 1,000 events per second) was registered in certain experimental conditions.

We have then found that cells which contained D2O frequently remain at high temperatures (in the vicinity of 100?C) before cooling rapidly to the bath temperature. Cells containing H2O can also be driven to the boiling point but such cells cool immediately on terminating the experiments. This phenomenon has become known as \"Heat after Death\" (the death referring to cessation of polarisation).

This is similar to the fission of uranium at A = 119 where the local maximum follows from the Maruhn-Greiner theory if the splitting nuclei are excited to about MeV energy. The LENR generated elements can be documented any time after the reaction by SIMS or K-shell X-ray excitation to show the very unique distribution with the local maximum. An explanation is based on the strong Debye screening of the Maxwellian deuterons within the degenerate rigid electron background especially within the swimming electron layer at the metal surface or at interfaces. The deuterons behave like neutrals at distances of about 2 picometers. They may form clusters due to soft attraction in the range above thermal energy. Clusters of 10 pm diameter may react over long time probabilities (megaseconds) with Pd nuclei leading to a double magic number compound nucleus which splits like in fission to the A = 153 element distribution.",

The force of each of them was evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of an atomic nucleus. As a result, it was found that there were two regions. One of them is the stronger Coulomb force region and the other is the stronger nuclear force region. At the boundary of these regions, both forces are equal to each other. It appears that if the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are placed in a suitable magnetic field, both the electron in the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are influenced by the magnetic lines of force. The author deemed that there might be an aperture of the energy barrier. If there is the aperture of such an energy barrier, there must be a possibility for two deuterium nuclei to collide and produce nuclear fusion without being under tremendous high temperatures. To confirm this possibility, the author has studied and evaluated the behavior of the charged particle and calculated the working force under the homogeneous and stable magnetic field. As an example, under this influence in the magnetic field, the working force, the behavior of a deuteron, a co-existing deuteron and an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy have been analyzed. However, the working force to the particle, the Lorentz force, is very small compared to the Coulomb force. The motion of the charged particle and the electron orbital plane in an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 in the magnetic field is the preferable direction. To analyze the possibility of nuclear fusion at room temperature, it is thought that a more advantageous circumstance than that proposed in this paper should be prepared.",

Here, in connection with the problem of the cold fusion of deuterons, an analysis is made of the influence of screening of the deuteron charges by electrons of the crystal on the penetrability of the Coulomb barrier. A study is made of the reaction-enhancement method in the case when the deuterons move in the general crystal potential well near one of the minima of the crystal potential",

    "abstract": "A nickel-hydride thin film was studied by the Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) method. The differences between a \"black\" film and a pure nickel film \"blank\" behaviour are showed. The black Ni-hydride film has been obtained by a short electrolysis with 1 M? Li2SO4 electrolyte in light water. A shift in the minimum of the observed reflected light occurs, together with a change in the minimum shape, i.e. its half-height width increases. This two phenomenon are due to the change in the electronic band structure of the metal induced by the electron added in the lattice by hydrogen. The changing of the electronic structure, revealed by the laser coupling conditions, leads to consider that an hydride phase was created. Both the blank (not hydrogenated) and black (hydrogenated) specimens were taken under He-Ne laser beam at the reflectance minimum angle for about three hours. A SIMS analysis was also implemented to reveal differences in the isotopic composition of Cu, as marker element, between the blank and black films, in order to study the coupled effect of electrolysis and plasmon-polariton excitation on LENR processes in condensed matter.",

We will briefly report the results of our campaign of experiments on piezonuclear reactions where ultrasounds and cavitation were applied to solutions of stable elements. These outcomes will be shown to be compatible with the results and evidences obtained from low energy nuclear reaction experiments. Some theoretical concepts and ideas, on which our experiments are grounded, will be sketched and it will be shown that, in order to trigger our measured effects, it exists an energy threshold, that has to be overcome, and a maximum interval of time for this energy to be released to the nuclear system. Eventually, a research hypothesis will be put forward about the chance to raise the level of analogy from the mere comparison of results up to the phenomenological level. Here, among the various evidences collected in LENR experiments, we will search for hints about the overcome of the energy threshold and about the mechanism that releases the loaded energy in a suitable interval of time.",

For this reason, it was (and has remained) imperative that instances of possible fraud, misconduct and sloppy work be reduced from the outset. Because of limited funding, as a consequence, the self-correcting process of science may not be operative in these areas.

Any proposed model must address this at the outset. At present, we recognize are two general approaches to the problem: mechanisms which transfer the reaction energy directly to a condensed matter mode, which requires the fractionation of a large quantum into many small quanta; mechanisms in which the large energy quantum is converted to kinetic energy over a very large number of neighboring nuclei. We have focused on the first approach, and we have found a model that seems to accomplish this. Here we introduce the model, which we call the \"lossy spin-boson model\". We find that energy exchange in the lossless spin-boson model is hindered due to destructive interference effects. Augmenting the model with loss removes the destructive interference, and we use perturbation theory on a specific example for illustration. Feshbach projection operators and the Brillouin-Wigner formalism which we adopt to describe loss in the model are reviewed in Appendix A.",

    "abstract": "Various cases of possible orthodox nuclear reaction processes, including newly proposed 4H/TSC fusion by simultaneous weak and strong interactions, 4H/TSC + Ni induced fission products, Ni + p reactions and reaction by deuteron impurity, are comparatively discussed for feasibility.(1) Ni + p nuclear reaction is impossibly difficult to make the Coulomb-field penetration of proton through so many inner electron shells (K, L, M), usually non-active in chemical reactions, of Ni-atom. Also the proton capture with Ni-nucleus, if any with kW level power, should emit lethal prompt gamma-rays which have never been observed. So, this type of nuclear reactions is unlikely.(2) Deuteron impurity (1/6700 in H2 gas usually) may induce (3H+D)/TSC fusion to be considered. Conditioning of 3-dimensional symmetry of QM-wave function for TSC is however of problem to condense into microscopic neutral entity small enough for causing any strong interactions.(3) The newly proposed 4H/TSCWS (weak-strong interaction simultaneously) fusion is a plausible scenario to have clean products (3He and proton, or deuterons) with significantly enhanced reaction rates in Ni nano-particles, for rare-conditioned (as discussed) visible heat generation with very weak secondary neutrons (10-13 order of 3He primary product)  and gamma-rays (10-11 order of 3He primary product). Degrees of the generation rate of 4H/TSC (t = 0) transient clusters in Ni-H nano-particles and the life-time elongation of 4H/TSC-minimum state are speculatively studied. The auto-recovery capability of Ni nano-catalyst is considered as the key.(4) The 4H/TSC + Ni-isotope capture-and-fission process, previously proposed in our paper of JCMNS 1 (2007) 86-96 is another plausible scenario, to result in generation of clean fission products in A < 60 mass region. More enhanced 4p + Ni to fission rates than the previous prediction is expected due to the possible elongation of 4H/TSC-minimum-state life time without complete nuclear break-up of the symmetric cluster under dynamic condensation.",

The earliest of these D+D cold fusion (CF) models is Julian Schwinger?s proposal (1990) to combine, in a single Hamiltonian, the attractive nuclear potential with the repulsive Coulomb potential to reach an excited state of 4He. The second was a pair of papers by Maly and Vavra (M&V) that, a few years later, provided a relativistic quantum mechanical model basis for deep electron orbits. A third was K.P. Sinha?s 1999 model to use a natural electron pairing in a lattice to form charge-polarized D+ D- pairs in a linear defect that is attractive rather than repulsive. Critical in Schwinger?s model is the ability to dissipate nuclear energy before the actual fusion of the nuclei takes place. Critical to M&V?s model is a deep-electron orbit predicted by relativistic quantum mechanics that, if occupied in deuterium, assured nuclear fusion. Critical in Sinha?s model is the ability to free the hydrogen sub-lattice spacing in a linear defect from the encompassing crystal?s lattice spacing. This present paper includes a connection with the more recently developed model (post-2015) of the deep-electron orbits and even more recent information (2019 and 2020) on new PdD phases and on models of properties of the hydrogen \"chain\". The importance and connection of each model?s contributions with recent information are highlighted. We are not proposing a specific model supported with detailed calculations. We are suggesting that (aspects of) prior models can be combined to form a unified (composite) model that would be more convincing to the other members of the Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) community (and others) than they would be individually.",

The resulting nuclides with atomic numbers Z are spread over the whole table of the periodic system. Based on our models of having the protons as an exotic plasma whose most energetic tail of about 1 to 2 eV reacts within about 2 pm distance where the Coulomb repulsion is reduced by screening, especially in the swimming electron layer, we derive a relation to the magic numbers of the nuclear shell model from the measured Z-dependence of the reaction probabilities. This agreement with the magic numbers is an excellent proof of consistency for the measurements. Furthermore, new higher magic numbers are predicted.",

    "abstract": "An attempt is made to build an LENR theory that does not contradict any basic principle of physics and gives a relatively simple explanation to the plethora of experimental results. A single unconventional assumption is made, namely that nuclei are kept together by a magnetic attraction mechanism, as proposed in the 1980s of the past century by Valerio Dallacasa and Norman Cook. This assumption contradicts a non-proven detail of the standard model, which instead attributes the nuclear force to a residual effect of the strong interaction. The theory is based also on a property of the electron which has been known for long, but has rarely been used: the Zitterbewegung (ZB). This property should allow the magnetic attraction mechanism that binds nucleons together, to manifest also between the electron and any isotope of hydrogen, leading to the formation of three neutral pseudo-particles (the component particles remain separate entities), collectively named here Hydronions (or Hyd). These pseudo-particles can then couple with other nuclei and lead to a fusion reaction \"inside\" the electron. The Coulomb barrier is not overcome kinetically, but through what could be interpreted as a range extension of the nuclear force itself, realized by the electron when some specific conditions are satisfied. The most important of these necessary conditions is that the electron has to \"orbit\" the hydrogen nucleus at a frequency of 2.055 x 1016Hz. This frequency corresponds to photons with an energy of about 85 eV or equivalently a wavelength of 14.6 nm in the Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV). So the large quanta of nuclear energy fractionate into EUV photons during the formation of the Hydronions and during the coupling of Hydronions to other nuclei. The formation of Hydronions requires the so called Nuclear Active Environment (NAE), which is what makes LENR so rare and difficult to reproduce. The numbers suggest that the NAE forms when an unshielded atomic core electron orbital that has an \"orbital frequency\" near to the coupling frequency is stricken by a naked Hydrogen Nucleus (HNu). This theory therefore implies that the NAE is not inside the metal matrix, but in its immediate neighbourhood. The best candidate atoms for a NAE are listed, based on the energy of their ionization energies. The coincidence with the most common LENR materials appears noteworthy. The Electron Mediated Nuclear Reactions (EMNR) theory can explain also very rapid runaway conditions, radio emissions, biological NAE, and the so called \"strange radiation\".",

Examples are given from a set of 26 intentionally similar current ramps which show three distinct Modes of loading performance: Mode A - a linear decrease of Pd resistance, beyond the resistance maximum, with logarithmic increase in electrochemical current; Mode B - an initial log-linear decrease on the Mode A trajectory, followed by a rapid increase in resistance when the resistance falls below a critical value; Mode C -? a shallow decrease in resistance with approximately symmetric increase as the [log] current density is increased beyond a threshold value similar to that for Mode B.

The EPRI program began in April, 1989, and has successfully confinned the presence of the claimed excess heat but has yet to determine its source. Measurable helium-4 has been observed in the cell vapor space in a few cases, but so far , not in a definitive manner. The major evidence that the heat may be from nuclear reactions is its magnitude - some 10 to 100 times larger than any known chemical reaction. The objective of the continuing effort is to identify the source of the excess heat. This paper focusses upon comparing measurements on cathodes that successfully produced excess heat with the same measurements on virgin material from the same batch of palladium. Initial measurements on one cathode that produced 0.56 megajoules of excess heat and its virgin counterpart are reported here. The analytical method chosen is a non destructive one known as prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) using thennal n~utrons in beams from research reactors. Since almost every isotope captures neutrons with the emission of several gamma rays unique to that isotope, any isotopic ratio changes from the heat production process will be converted to a change in the relative ratios of gamma ray intensities. Such ratios can be measured to an accuracy in the range around 1 % using high resolution gennanium detection systems. Thus any changes due to the production or loss of any isotope present can be detected and related to the excess heat produced. One such measurement using PGAA appears to show an -18% reduction in the ratio of boron-l 0 to palladium-l05 in the active cathode relative to the ratio in virgin material. Conventional explanations of this result such as selective chemical leaching of boron by the electrolyte are currently being tested.",

Most excess heat occurs when the ratio is 0.5 < D/Pd < 0.7. Three different cathode pretreatments were tested.

Pd powder (PP), Pd-black (PB), Pd nano-particles (\"10nm!) admixed with ZrO2 (PZ) and Pd?Ni binary nano-particles (\"2 nm!) dispersed in ZrO2 holder-flakes (PNZ2B) has been examined. For the PP, the PB and the PZ samples, both the deoxidized samples and those reused without baking process showed essentially the same values of the loading ratio D(H)/Pd, the specific output energy E1 and the hydridation energy QD(H) which are consistent with the published values for bulky samples. For the as-received and oxidized samples both D(H)/Pd and E1 are increasing functions of fineness of the Pd surface, and exceeds 2.0 and 1.5 eV/atom-Pd, respectively, for the PZ sample, giving the hydridation energy larger than the published value of the surface adsorption energy of 0.5 eV for bulky Pd samples. A rather large isotope effect in the differential heat of sorption, \"D(H), has sometimes been observed in the 1a-phase characteristic of the oxygen-treated samples. The Pd0.04Ni0.29Zr0.67 oxide composite sample, PNZ2B, has unique properties: Both D(H)/[Pd?Ni] # 3.0 and E1 # 1.4 eV/atom- [Pd?Ni] for the as-received, the oxidized and deoxidized sample runs are very large, while QD(H) = 0.50? 0.1 eV/atom-D(H) for all cases is modest. It is inferred that the Pd atoms act as a catalyst for the hydrogen isotope absorption/adsorption of Ni at room temperature. From the fact that the No. 2 run after the forced deoxidation has essentially the same values of the absorption parameters as those of the No. 1 and No. 3 runs, it is inferred that the surface adsorption potential is made shallower in the PNZ2B sample than in Pd-based samples.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we look into the difficult question of electron deep levels in the hydrogen atom. An introduction shows some general considerations on these orbits as \"anomalous\" (and usually rejected) solutions of relativistic quantum equations. The first part of our study is devoted to a discussion of the arguments against the deep orbits and for them, as exemplified in published solutions. We examine each of the principal negative arguments found in the literature and show how it is possible to resolve the questions raised. In fact, most of the problems are related to the singularity of the Coulomb potential when considering the nucleus as a point charge, and so they can be easily resolved when considering a more realistic potential with finite value inside the nucleus. In the second part, we consider specific works on deep orbits as solutions of the relativistic Schr?dinger and of the Dirac equations, named Dirac Deep Levels (DDLs). The latter presents the most complete solution and development for spin1 /2 particles, and includes an infinite family of DDL solutions. We examine particularities of these DDL solutions and more generally of the anomalous solutions. We next analyze the methods for, and the properties of, the solutions that include a corrected potential inside the nucleus, and we examine the questions raised by this new element. Finally, we indicate, in the conclusion, open questions such as the physical meaning of the relation between quantum numbers determining the deep levels and the fact that the angular momentum seems two orders-of-magnitude lower than the values associated with the Planck constant. As a prerequisite to a deep comprehension of the resolution methods, we recall in the appendices some essential elements of the Dirac theory.",

This process, at leading order, proceeds by emission of a photon. In the present case we consider two photon emission and hence we need to go to the second order in perturbation theory. The emission of a high energy photon from the initial D-H system leads to the formation of an intermediate state which is a superposition of all energy eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.

If neutron generation occurs, we can deduce from the past experimental results that it occurs after a small increase of kinetic energy of deuterium atoms.

It is, however, often observed that the deuterium loading ratio struts decreasing after reaching a maximum value under a same electrolytic condition, and the maximum loading ratio could not be sustained for a necessary period of time to come up to observe any excess heat.To maintain such achieved high loading ratio, we have devised and confirmed a new technique based on a finding that a cell voltage during the electrolysis is one of the most important key factors to control such deloading.As the result of our new method, when the cell voltage is kept constant, accordingly electrolytic currents increase at a certain rate, the maximum deuterium loading can be maintained for more than 200 hours.

The Energy Research Center (ERC) has been examining and verifying BEC?s calorimetry for over 18 months since 2 of the calorimeters have been moved from SRI International to BEC?s laboratory. We have continued our testing of new materials, material fabrication techniques, and electrical stimulation methods to produce excess power and energy output. By applying fast pulses of several hundred volts and tens of nanoseconds long, the current follows the \"skin-effect\" principle and is concentrated at the outer metal?ceramic interface but returns through the bulk of the Cu. Two stimulation methods were used ? steady-state and dynamic. In the steady-state method, the pulse power is measured directly using fast oscilloscopes that record the voltage across the catalyst and a shunt resistor in series with the catalyst. The resistance of the shunt resistor is measured accurately under DC and pulse conditions. The input pulse power is determined by multiplying the calculated root-mean-square voltage and current and recorded every 10 s. Using a version of the system identification (SI) heat-flow model designed specifically for the BEC calorimeter, the power reaching the five temperature sensors is determined during simultaneous continuous ramps of both heater and pulse powers. The power emanating from the catalyst is determined during sequences of less frequent, longer duration, low voltage pulses (LVP) and compared to that found using more frequent, shorter duration, high voltage pulses (HVP). The power determined during the less frequent LVP is set as the input power during that sequence. The power of the stimulation pulses during the more frequent HVP sequences is maintained equal to that during the less frequent LVP. Then the calculated power output from the tube is divided by that calculated during the reference sequences, giving a so-called coefficient of performance (COP). We have also used mass flow calorimetry to determine COP. Low voltage, long pulses are chosen to match the input power from high voltage, short pulses. The low voltage pulses are not thought to stimulate LENR, while the high voltage pulses are. This provides a method to compare matching input power under conditions that stimulate LENR with conditions that do not. Any excess heat detected from the high voltage pulse condition is considered to be generated by LENR rather than resistive heating.",

However, since it is almost impossible for these helium atoms to then escape from the Pd-black host to the surrounding environment at ambient temperature, to confirm their presence it is absolutely essential that Pd-black samples be heated to high temperatures to expel whatever helium they may contain. Therefore, to confirm the existence of helium atoms generated from deuterium in samples of Pd-black, we simply employed the\u201cSample Heating\u201dprocess (room temperature _??_1500\u00b0C), but carried it out using both a\u201cQMS\u201dsystem and a super-high vacuum favorable\u201cGetter pump\u201dinside a totally sealed vessel.

The analysis was performed by (i) selecting the intervals of the D/Pd, T and P signals where the daily oscillations occurred, (ii) filtering the signals to remove low-frequency noise, (iii) analyzing the waveforms of the daily oscillations, (iv) applying Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), (v) performing a statistical test on the obtained IMFs in order to identify the physically most meaningful oscillation mode, (vi) performing an power spectral analysis, (vii) calculating the correlations between the signals, and (viii) determining the time-dependent phase synchronization between the signals. We found that (i) in all three signals (D/Pd, T and P) a clear daily oscillation was present while the current density J did not show such an oscillation, (ii) the daily oscillation in T and P had similar waveforms and where anti-correlated to the oscillation in D/Pd, (iii) D/Pd and T had the highest correlation (r = 0.7693), (iv) all three signals exhibited phase synchronization over the whole signal length while the strongest phase synchronization took place between D/Pd and T . Possible origins of the daily oscillation were discussed and implications for further investigations and experiments were outlined.",

    "abstract": "The LEC, a simple device producing electrical energy, was discovered by American scientists Frank Gordon and Harper J Whitehouse. They have described it as a ?contact potential difference device?. The two electrode plates that form the cell are not in physical contact, being separated by any one of a number of gases. Various experiments and their results are described, typically ones where the surface of a ?working electrode? is co-deposited with hydrogen and another metal, for example Fe or Pd. Voltage is measured between a carefully washed and dried working electrode and a plain metal counter electrode, the distance between them is 0.5-1mm. The interstitial gas may be hydrogen, deuterium, air or other gases, and a voltage of several hundred millivolts can be measured [Ref. 1]. Alan Smith, a British scientist, created working electrodes by simple electrolysis of metal plates in light water without co-deposition and reproduced the LEC effect with different metals. [Ref. 4]. Recently Qiuran Laboratory has devoted considerable time to studying the LEC effect and we present some preliminary experimental results in which LEC phenomena have been observed. These experiments are qualitative ones in which iron plating, nickel plating, copper plating and electrolysis are used to activate working electrode surfaces and electrical measurements made to determine if LEC voltage is generated. Since the results reported here are ?early stage? we confess the methods are not yet refined, and we suffered some problems, including hydrogen valve leaks.",

The exposed bcc crystal lattice Ti target foil, TF, measured an average of 39 x 10^12 +/- 1.4 trapped 4He atoms. The fcc crystal lattices of Pd, Ag, Ni, and Cu target foils, particularly the two measured fcc Pd TF lattices produced ~ 0.35 x 10^12 trapped 4He atoms. This helium level was just above its background level, and 1/100 that of the bcc Ti TF. In the fcc palladium TF, SEM crater volume measurements show that most of the alphas are ejected into the circulating D2O, where they were measured in the gas phase. In 1994 the samples were run at LANL and measured at PNNL. The helium was measured by melting small TF pieces cut from the active center zone. Then each piece was placed in a crucible, and melted under vacuum, releasing all gases including background helium. These collected gases from one piece were pretreated; then were measured. The data was converted to total 4He atoms trapped in the active zone of the TF lattice. A total of 24 measurements for 3He and 4He on three TFs found no 3He but 4He in all 12 measurements.

An introduction shows the importance of the deep orbits of hydrogen (H or D) for research in the LENR domain, and gives some general considerations on the Electron Deep Orbits (EDO) and on other works about deep orbits. A first part recalls the known criticism against the EDO and how we face it. At this occasion we highlight the difference of resolution of these problems between the relativistic Schr?dinger equation and the Dirac equation, which leads for this latter, to consider a modified Coulomb potential with finite value inside the nucleus. In the second part, we consider the specific work of Maly and Va?vra on deep orbits as solutions of the Dirac equation, the so-called Deep Dirac Levels (DDLs). As a result of some criticism about the matching conditions at the boundary, we verified their computation, but by using a more complete ansatz for the \"inside\" solution. We can confirm the approximate size of the mean radii ?r? of DDL orbits and that ?r? decreases when the Dirac angular quantum number k increases. This latter finding is a self-consistent result since (as distinct from the atomic-electron orbitals) the binding energy of the DDL electron increases (in absolute value) with k. We observe that the essential element for obtaining deep orbits solutions is special relativity.",

This is an example of a quantum state, which is mathematically acceptable in the sense of being square integrable and having a finite binding energy but yet is rejected as unphysical due in part to the point-nucleus nature of the model. Then the Dirac equation is studied for the existence of states which are similarly mathematically acceptable but whose physical acceptability requires physical judgment. States of Landau symmetry are found which meet these criteria. The existence of states of ambiguous physical interpretation for both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations depends on using a point-nucleus versus a finite-nucleus potential model. On using a realistic model for the charge distribution of the proton, a Klein-Gordon state is found in the binding range of 5 keV, but no state is found for the Dirac equation.",

All the anti-Stokes peaks are relatively missing in the undriven mode for all of the nanostructured materials. Weak anti-Stokes peaks are elicited from Pd (and Ni and their alloy) nanostructured material in ZrO2. But when NANOR-type components are electrically driven, there is diversity in outcome. When driven in the avalanche mode, the anti-Stokes peaks differ considerably from those which appear during the excess heat (XSH)-producing or desired mode. The anti-Stokes peak(s) differ in energy, amount, and in what stimulates their appearance. However, normal anti-Stokes peaks return when the electrical drive creates \"avalanche mode\" characterized by higher electrical current at decreasing voltage. The avalanche anti-Stokes peaks are many, and they are lower energy than the XSH mode produced anti-Stokes peak (described main text). By contrast, successful cold fusion is heralded by a large increase in the anti-Stokes to Stokes (aS/S) ratio, and the generated anti-Stokes peak for the desired and XSH-producing state is very different from the avalanche-generated multiple anti-Stokes peaks. That XSHrelated peak is singular and at higher energy. This distinguishing, higher energy, single, anti-Stokes peak is also not seen in the \"off\" state or the avalanche (undesirable) mode. Our analysis finds that the excess-heat produced anti-Stokes peak is matched to the Stokes line of PdD. We also find that the several lower energy anti-Stokes in avalanche mode (unsuccessful regarding CF/LANR) are matched to the many Stokes peaks for zirconia. In the desired electric-driven XSH-producing mode, the two-terminal deuterided NANORr-type CF/LANR component has a measured Boltzmann Stokes ratio ~1.3. Analysis of the phonon gain heralds ~7^+/- 0 15 acoustic phonons assisting nuclear reactions and a core peak calculated Stokes temperature of circa 1645 K.

Deuterium loading is carried out in a series of steps by passing a D.C. current to ohmically heat the sample for some time in D2 gas until a measurable quantity is absorbed. After every loading, the wire resistance and decrease in the gas pressure are measured at room temperature using a four probe resistance meter (?0.2% accuracy) and an oil manometer respectively.Significantly, it is observed that an apparently simple property like electrical resistance is not easily reproducible. The pre loading heat treatment and residual gases in high vacuum appear to play an important role on the behaviour of the resistance in TiDx. The preliminary results also suggest that this property may not be useful in estimating the deuterium content in titanium.",

A previously proposed multibody deuteron fusion model in solids is elaborated further to explain these anomalous results. A transient dynamics in metal deuterides is proposed to generate close pairs and clusters of deuterons with time-dependent deep atomic potential inducing a strong screening effect on Coulomb barrier penetration. Very approximate numerical estimations of reaction rates for the competing 2D, 3D, and 4D fusion processes in PdDx and TiDx are obtained with high-level reaction rates enough to explain observed heat levels.

These results were found to be fully repeatable and supported the authors' proposition1) that solid state plasma fusion (\u201cCold Fusion\u201d) can be generated in energetic deuterium Strongly Coupled Plasma (\u201cSC-plasma\u201d). This fusion reaction is thought to be sustained by localized \u201cLatticequake\u201d in a solid-state media with the deuterium density equivalent to that of the host solid. While exploring this basic proposition, the characteristic differences when compared with ultra high temperature-state plasma fusion (\u201cHot Fusion\u201d) are clarified. In general, the most essential reaction product in both types of the deuterium plasma fusion is considered to be helium, irrespective of the \u201cwell-known and/or unknown reactions\u201d, which is stored within the solid-state medium in abundance as a \u201cResidual Product\u201d, but which generally can not enter into nor be released from host-solid at a room temperature. Even measuring instruments with relatively poor sensitivity should be able to easily detect such residual helium.

Further, we focus on tunnelling the Coulomb barrier existent between two deuterons. Analysing the possible contributions of lattice on improving the tunnelling probability, we will find that there is a real mechanism through which this probability could be increased: this mechanism is the screening effect due to d-shell electrons of palladium lattice.

Data of 50-140 W/kg level excess thermal power was repeatedly obtained by CNZ-type samples with H-gas at elevated temperatures after the saturation of H-gas absorption (endothermic) by sample. Excess thermal power of ca. 50?70 W continued for more than two weeks by 505 g CNZ7r (re-calcined) sample, with very strange evolution of the cooled-flat and oscillating TC4 RC upper flange temperatures. . . . .",

For example, the estimation of the energy involved in the formation of a 2 ?m crater is 3 ? 10-8 J or 2 ? 105 MeV. Some theories attempting to explain these phenomena, and excess heat in general, involve the role of Exotic Neutral Particles (ENP), like Polyneutrons or Erzions. According to such theories, these ENPs are relatively rare. The problem investigated in this paper is whether a single particle may trigger a series of many reactions within a short time in solids that are properly loaded. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been written to study the potential behavior of ENPs. It is shown that the ENPs follow a developed and Brownian type movement. The number of reactions occurring at a given depth below the surface is calculated, as well as the probability for a series to exceed a given value. From a pure mathematical viewpoint, a parallel can be made between the diffusion laws and Brownian motion. It is shown that a small fraction of the ENP flux can trigger large series of reaction, to the point that the energy that can be produced is not limited if the ENP is stable as long as it is present in the lattice. It is necessary to introduce a limited lifetime with a decay to reconcile the model with the experimental observations. The discussion of the simulation results in the light of experimental data leads me to propose a mean free path on the order of 100 ?, and a lifetime in the nanosecond range.",

There have been attempts to explain anomalous heat by deuteron?deuteron nuclear fusion in the Pd lattice while the search for radiation was unsuccessful which indicated that the origin of the excess heat is unknown. Despite the unknown origin of the excess heat, Pd system is in the core of the research for energy production. The excess heat has been demonstrated by using calorimeters that are well characterized. However, these measurements are not able to provide detailed information about a localized heat rather than a heat from a large area. A new method is demonstrated to investigate an excess heat from Pd electrode loaded with deuterium or hydrogen. It is capable of measuring a small amount of heat generated in a localized area with a sub-micrometer resolution by fluorescence imaging with temperature sensitive fluorescence dyes. Considering quantum yield, photostability, and thermal stability, rhodamine 6G (R6G) is selected for temperature sensor along with a polymer, Poly MethylSilsesquioxane (PMSSQ). The thermal quenching of fluorescence resulted in a decreased temperature over time with heat generation. We envisioned that this new method of the temperature measurement provided a novel diagnostic tool for localized excess heat which was not detectable by calorimetry due to intrinsic disability.",

Srinivasan5 recently published an update of the international status of cold fusion research.

Leggett and Baym,8 however, have shown that the maximum fusion rate cannot be higher than ~10- 5 3 s _1/deuteron-deuteron (d-d) pair in palladium metal. This limit can be exceeded when the increase in the fusion rate is brought about by a high degree of coherence among the interactions in the system. Schwinger9 postulated a coherent mechanism based on the screening of Coulomb interactions by lattice phonons to explain the high fusion rate. In this technical note, we propose that the wave nature of the propagating deuteron and the periodicity of the Pd-D lattice can lead to coherent d-d interactions and very high d-d fusion rates under certain circumstances",

This was a BIG DEAL. Their discovery was announced around the world. Everyone realized the importance. People predicted that the pollution being caused by oil extraction and transport could be eliminated. Nuclear accidents would no longer be a worry. We now know that if this clean energy had been developed 31 years ago, future global warming would have been reduced. As result, the rejection has had serious consequences to the future of civilization. I was working at LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) at the time. The laboratory was attempting to develop fission power for use in space, which is a very difficult problem.  In fact, having sufficient power for extended space travel is still a problem. The power produced by cold fusion could be the ideal solution. As result, people at Los Alamos became very exited.

About 10 big burst events were observed during the 5-day continuous measurement: it was found that the radiation intensity increased simultaneously as the heater temperature suddenly increased. We have made a comparison of the radiant spectrum of the burst event with the spectrum in normal times. There is no particular difference due to the burst; both spectra can be simply interpreted as grey body radiation emitted from a thermally equilibrated object. The correlation of radiant intensity between near-IR and visible light has been deduced; although it is expected there is a linear correlation between them, two correlation lines can be drawn instead of one.

Some Russian and French researchers have considered these particles to be magnetic monopoles. The mechanisms of energy deposition and track formation, while among the most important properties, are contradictory and the least understood of all of the observations. Our method of producing these tracks differs markedly from most other studies in that no electrical discharge is used as a source. Rather, tracks are created with a simple uniform exposure to photons. This simpler method of producing exactly the same tracks supports a more comprehensive exploration of particle track properties. Out of 750 exposures with this method, elliptic particle tracks were detected, 22 of which were compared to Bohr?Sommerfeld electron orbits in an idealized model. Ellipses fitted to the tracks were found to have quantized semi-major axis sizes with ratios of ? n2/a2 to corresponding Bohr?Sommerfeld hydrogen ellipses. This prompts inquiry relevant to magnetic monopoles due to the n2/a2 force difference between magnetic charge and electric charge using the Schwinger quantization condition. Analogy with the electron indicates that the elliptic tracks could be created by a bound magnetically charged particle with mass mm = 1.45 ? 10^-3 eV/c2, yet with superluminal velocities. Using a modified extended relativity model, mm becomes the relativistic mass of a superluminal electron, with m0 = 5.11 ? 10^5 eV/c2, the fine structure constant becomes a mass ratio and charge quantization is the result of two states of the electron. Relevance of this new model is considered in light of the observed inconsistencies in track formation.",

Though there are good reasons against many publications to this topic but not to all what was reported. It seems to be indicated to summarize the following serious, reproducible and confirmed observations on reactions of protons or deuterons incorporated in host metals such as palladium, nickel and other metals. We underline the confusing discovery by Cockroft and Oliphant with the anomalously low energy for nuclear reactions which was hundred times lower than in the usual cases when smashing nuclei against their Coulomb potential. A similar unexpected result was that of Otto Hahn?s-the chemist!-discovery of fission that had changed the world. A significant result for cold fusion was seen in gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant and fully reproducible, e.g. from the \"life after death\" heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect-preferably in the swimming electron layer-may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U of about megaseconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the generation of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-megasecond reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nuclei generation, magic numbers and to quarkgluon plasmas.

One of these principles has been the prediction that the partial molar enthalpy of absorption of hydrogen (or  deuterium) in palladium (5) will become positive at the high charging ratios (X = DlPd) required for excess enthalpy generation (6,7), see Fig 1.Although a transition from exothermic to endothermic absorption is probably not a necessary condition for achieving excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperaturesl , such a transition will certainly facilitate the achievement of high charging ratios. For example, increases of temperature will then themselves lead to increases in X and thereby in the rates of excess enthalpy generation. These are the conditions required for the development of \"positive feedback\" and; in this paper, we report on two lines of investigation which have indicated the presence of these effects. We then outline the way in which our understanding of this phenomenon has guided our investigation of excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperatures.",

At the surface of the Sr implanted Pd/CaO multilayer foil, Mo was clearly detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after deuterium gas permeation. After the D2 permeation, the sample was heat treated in the air to remove S which condensed at the surface during the permeation. After the successful removal of S, Mo could be clearly detected by XPS on the surface of the 88Sr+ implanted Pd/CaO multilayer foil. The isotopic abundance ratio of the surface Mo measured by TOF-SIMS was similar to that of natural Mo. However, after the removal of the outermost surface layer with ion sputtering, the observed isotopic abundance ratio of Mo changed from that of natural Mo with an isolatedly strong peak at a mass close to 96Mo. This result duly suggests that the transmutation from 88Sr to 96Mo had took place, although the peak of m/z = 96 might be also assigned to GaAl+, Ca2O+ or CaFe+, beside 96Mo+.

In Ken Shoulders words, EVO?s are, \"Highly organized, micron-sized clusters of electrons, having soliton behavior, with electron populations density on the order of Avogadro?s number per cm3 (A typical 2?m EVO has a population of 1011 to 1013 electrons).

Using an ordinary thermal interpretation, a thermal gradient for bulk material greater than 26,000 degrees C per micrometer would be required to achieve these effects\". This paper presents lessons from thin film deposition methods like Vacuum Arc, Pulsed Electron beam, Pulsed Laser whose commonality with EVO generation is pulse energy impingement on a target. Rather than the hypothesis of a \"new form of matter\" as an explanation of EVO?s, it is hypothesized that generation of a micro shaped-charge, in analogy with explosively formed shaped-charge munitions, can explain the characteristics of surfaces that were struck by EVO?s.

    "abstract": "Excitation transfer has long been of interest in biophysics, where electronic excitation is transferred from one location to another mediated by photon exchange. We are interested in the transfer of nuclear excitation mediated by phonon exchange, which according to our theoretical approach lies at the foundation of many anomalies in Condensed Matter Nuclear Science. The transfer of excitation from one site to another involves coupling to off-resonant intermediate states with either no excitation or double excitation; as such it is a quantum mechanical effect with no classical counterpart. The indirect coupling interaction can be determined from second-order perturbation theory for an electric dipole (E1) interaction, and the resulting interaction is weak due to destructive interference. We present results for resonant phonon-mediated excitation transfer based on the relativistic phonon-nuclear boost interaction identified recently. The analysis is extended to the more complicated case of magnetic dipole (M1) interactions, where fourth-order perturbation theory is needed for the interaction. We find severe destructive interference effects very much weaken the indirect interaction in both cases. Some improvement is possible due to loss; however, the improvement seems insufficient to account for the effects seen in excitation transfer experiments in our lab. To address this issue, we propose here that shifts in the off-resonant basis state energies could lead to much larger indirect interactions. The evaluation of shifts in the basis state energies is a major project, which requires the specification of the nucleon-nucleon interaction off of resonance, and the evaluation of off-resonant binding energies; these are projects to be addressed in the future. The transverse Breit interaction is given off of resonance. The resulting indirect interaction for excitation transfer is consistent with a delocalized transfer effect, and also with cooperative (Dicke) enhancements; we expect shifts in the basis state energies to lead to new models for up-conversion and downconversion as well. Possible connections between the model and recent experimental results from excitation transfer experiments involving a 57 Co source on steel are discussed. We also consider incoherent excitation transfer, where the large excitation associated with the D2/4 He transition is transferred to highly excited unstable states in the nuclei of the host lattice. While the mechanism was proposed many years ago to account for low-level emission of energetic alphas, there has subsequently been no clarification of mechanism associated with these experiments, which provides motivation for us to consider the possibility of confirming or rejecting the mechanism through a systematic study where the ejected particle energy is determined as a function of the nuclear mass of host lattice nuclei. The argument is extended to excitation transfer from the HD/3 He transition, where few MeV alpha emission may be a candidate explanation for the observations of Storms and Scanlan, and where proton emission from 6Li may be a candidate explanation for the 0.79MeV proton signal reported by Lipinski and Lipinski.",

The reaction occurs in two consecutive steps: the first is a Volmer-Tafel reaction which occurs when the overpotential is less than 0.3 V. But as the measured coverage \u03b8D approaches unity, the deuterons begin to discharge onto the adsorbed deuterium (Heyrovsky mechanism). The second (consecutive) step leads to the tritium formation via a neutron transfer from the electrode to the Pd-D bond which at this stage (near to full occupancy by D) is relatively weak. The ready availability of neutrons in the surface region of the metal catalyst is rationalized in terms of the high electron concentration associated with the surface and he presence of D arriving from D2O in the solution: e- + D+ = 2 neutrons + a neutrino.

Cold fusion technology would greatly enhance such projects, increasing the amount of carbon by a factor of ten and reducing the cost of the project by a large factor.

In the Air Flow Calorimetry method (AFC), the fluid is air. AFC appears to be a relatively simple method to measure the amount of heat produced by an LENR reactor. It is well suited when the LENR reactor surface temperature is high. It is easier to build than mass flow calorimeters using water-cooled or oil-cooled systems. Basically, the calorimeter is designed such that all the heat produced by the device under test is transferred to a known mass flow of cooling air. The accuracy of the method is governed by the control of the heat losses, the mass flow-rate of cooling air, the air heat capacity, the measure of the average air temperatures at inlet and outlet. Transpiration cooling is an efficient design to minimize the heat losses. The AFC method can be applied to reactors of any size and surface temperature. Its use is restricted to the testing of reactors that work continuously, because thermal equilibrium must be reached to make valid measurements. A thorough calibration procedure is essential to minimize the influence of errors on mass flows and temperature differences.",

It is possible to detail what is expected of LENR theorists by experimentalists, teachers, students, developers and other interested personnel. We provide and discuss ten questions for LENR theoreticians about the description (characteristics) and status (development) of their ideas. The nearly three decades of theoretical work on LENR has resulted in remarkably few well-developed theories. None of them has yet been adequately tested and widely accepted.

In such a condition, the classical ions contribute to the screening more strongly than the quantum electrons do. Results on the 7Li+p and 6Li+d reactions with liquid Li target will be shown.

It is found that the variation of the flux was the significant precursor of the anomalous heat, because a remarkable heat flow was detected when the Df? was becoming obviously larger. The experiment was repeated for more than 16 times, and the maximum heat flow detected was 4.8mW whereas the accuracy of the calorimeter is better than 30\u03bcW. There were no heat flow detected when the temperature of the device was increased and when the D2 pressure difference equaled to zero. Neither heat flow nor flux was observed in the control experiment using N2.gas. The results of TLD (Themoluminescence dosimeter) detection implied a nuclear origin of the heat flow because the dosage of radiation in reaction vessel was often higher than that in reference vessel.",

This precise evaluation of the rate of enthalpy generation relies on the non-linear regression fitting of the \"black-box\" model of the calorimeter to an extensive set of temperature time measurements. The method of data analysis gives a systematic underestimate of the enthalpy output and, in consequence, a slightly negative excess rate of enthalpy generation for an extensive set of blank experiments using both light and heavy water. By contrast, the electrolysis of heavy water at palladium electrodes shows a positive excess rate of enthalpy generation; this rate increases markedly with current density, reaching values of approximately 100 W cm^-3 at approximately 1 A cm^-2. It is also shown that prolonged polarization of palladium cathodes in heavy water leads to bursts in the rate of enthalpy generation; the thermal output of the cells exceeds the enthalpy input (or the total energy input) to the cells by factors in excess of 40 during these bursts. The total specific energy output during the bursts as well as the total specific energy output of fully charged electrodes subjected to prolonged polarization (5-50 MJ cm^-3) is 10^2 - 10^3 times larger than the enthalpy of reaction of chemical processes.",

Since it may be possible that the lattice will respond to the mass change associated with a excited nuclear state, we adopt a relativistic description throughout based on a many-particle Dirac formalism. This approach has not been used in the past, perhaps due to the difficulty in separating the center of mass and relative degrees of freedom of the nuclear system, or perhaps due to an absence of applications for such a model. In response to some recent ideas about how to think about the center of mass and relative separation, we obtained from the Dirac model a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which the lattice couples to different states within the composite nuclei within the lattice. In this description the different nuclear states have different mass energies and kinetic energies, as we had expected. In addition there appear new terms which provide for nuclear excitation as a result of coupling to the composite momentum. This new effect comes about because of changes in the composite nuclear state as a result of the dynamical Lorentz boost in the lattice.",

Progress in the LENR field will be reviewed with primary focus on the experimental work performed at SRI by and with its close collaborators with a view to defining experiments based non-traditional understandings of new physical effects in metal deuterides.

Since m* is a decreasing function of deuterium ion bulk density n0, the exponential barrier tunneling factor decreases rapidly with m*. As a result, the fusion rate reaches a maximum at a loading density above zero but less than saturation. This can explain observations of transient neutron output from the (3He,n) branch of D-D fusion. At low energy, D-D reactions favor the (T,p) branch. Fast product tritium may be captured by palladium isotopes to form excited-state Ag*, removing tritium from the system and preventing deuterium-tritium fusion. This may decay by alpha or proton emission, yielding fast ions and excited state Rh* or Pd*. Fast ion collisional \u201ctrapping\u201d may occur at Fermi electron speeds, enhancing in situ upscattering and yielding increased D-D reaction rates.

Cavitation jets implant high-density deuteron clusters into a target foil. Clusters are then squeezed by accelerated charges that form dense transient EM pulses. Cavitation and the associated sonoluminescence phenomena, used as a measuring tool, helps develop and explain related experimental results. Two outcomes, sonofusion and sono-superconductivity both produce D+clusters in reactors of different geometries. MHz reactor No. 1 is driven by a disk piezo and has produced excess heat, Qx, using the foil target and other products, including 4He. The newMHz reactor No. 2 is driven by a cylindrical piezo lowpower with a concentric wire target with transient cluster steady state concentration near the wire surface. The target?s steady state cluster coverage may satisfy a sono-superconductivity subsurface cluster connectivity during the MHz?s 100 ns collective sonoluminescence pulse. It was anticipated that ambient sono-superconductivity was possible but so far has proved difficult to measure. Cavitation D2O bubbles in both reactors were controlled by three main parameters for the two reactors: temperature, pressure of Ar gas over D2O, and acoustic watt input; Ti, Pi, andQa. The z-pinch jets?contents of deuterons and electrons were implanted, with an induced picosecond transient charge separation. This charge separation produced an electromagnetic, EM, cluster compression pulse that formed a high-density BEC environment, as the EM pulse pressure overwhelmed repulsive deuteron cluster pressure for that picosecond. This model used unique attributes of the high-density transient deuterons to produce sonofusion in reactor No. 1 and sono-superconductivity in reactor No. 2 near ambient temperature. The measurements showed the presence of sonoluminescence pulses, implanted plasma, and heat pulse ejecta sites.",

Tritium analysis was performed before and after each experiment on the Pd, the electrolyte and the gas in the head space. No tritium generation was observed in four identical Pd cathodes in H2SO4 cells operated at the same time under the same conditions. A cyclic loading-unloading regime with low current densities, rather than the usual continuous constant current regime, was employed to attain D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ? 0.05 reproducibly. D/Pd loadings greater than 0.8 ?0.05 appear to be necessary to generate tritium. The largest amount of tritium, generated in 7 days of continuous electrolysis, was 2.1 x 10E11 tritium atoms, compared with a background of 4 x 10E9 tritium atoms. The concentration of tritium and its axial distribution in the Pd were determined and concentrations of up to 9 x 10E10 atoms/g Pd were found compared with a maximum background of 5 x 10E8 atoms g-1. The T/D ratio in the Pd is about 100 times larger than in the electrolyte or gas and indicates that tritium generation occurs in the Pd interior rather than at its surface. No tritium generation was observed in two other types of Pd electrodes in D2SO4, despite the attainment of D/Pd ratios near 1:1. Thus high D/Pd ratios appear to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for tritium generation in D2SO4 electrolysis.",

His goal was to answer two critical questions: Does cold fusion produce helium along with excess heat, like a plasma fusion reaction? And if so, does it produce roughly as much helium per joule of energy as a plasma fusion reaction does? He answers both questions affirmatively. When a cold fusion palladium cathode becomes active, it releases helium into the electrolyte. The helium leaves the cell in the effluent deuterium and oxygen gas. Cathodes that produced more excess heat produced greater amounts of helium. The ratio of helium to energy is roughly comparable to that of hot fusion, within an order of magnitude.

According to this secondary nuclear process, the generated neutrons and protons inside the solid has the chance to recombine into deuterium atoms for heavy water systems. In this sense the Huizenga's second and third miracles, the branching ratio miracle and the no nuclear products miracle, are therefore equivalent. This paper also proposes a \"pycnon field\" to try to treat the correlation of the high dlPd ratio and pycno-reactions. Although the detail has not been worked out yet.",

Correlated with the excess heat appears to be 4He, with the associated energy near 24 MeV per helium atom. In nuclear reactions, the energy produced is expressed through the kinetic energy of the products; hence it would be natural to assume that some of the reaction energy ends up as kinetic energy of the 4He nucleus. Depending on the energy that the helium nucleus is born with, it will result in radiation (such as neutrons or x-rays) that can be seen outside of the cell. We have computed estimates of the expected neutron and x-ray emission as a function of helium energy, and compared the results with upper limits taken from experiments.

The cathode loading is improved for Pd and Pd-Rh with a surface modified by thiourea and Pd modified by Pd-Rh deposit, while reduction of the cathode loading was observed when the surface of the Pd-Rh alloy cathode was modified by P d -black. These results show clearly importance of controlling the surface catalytic property of the cathode in controlling and improving the maximum cathode loading.

The investigations of samples were performed in an UHV system equipped with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The results fail to confirm the existence of the phenomenon but observations of long-term variations of the terrestrial neutron background within about 40% were made. Variations observed in the neutron background with weather and between day and night are consistent with the supposition that it arises primarily from spallations induced by cosmic protons which penetrate the earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.

The essential feature of this model is the coupling of the interfacial processes with the transport of interstitials in the electrode interior. It is shown that boundary conditions arise from the solution of equations governing the elementary adsorption-desorption and adsorption-absorption steps and the symmetry of the electrode. Effects of the choice of rate constants of the elementary steps and the charging current on the surface coverage, the electrode potential and the time required to complete electrode charging are examined.",

Dash et al. over the last ten years have been analyzed using the TNCF model. Surface topographies of the cathodes showed characteristic fine structures where the results of nuclear transmutation (NT) were detected. Nuclear transmutations, characterized by their locality, are accompanied by excess heat generation, which suggests a nuclear origin. The products of nuclear transmutation are explained either by decay of excited cathode element nuclei to form an element of higher mass number than the original (nuclear transmutation by decay, or NTD) or by fission of these nuclei (nuclear transmutation by fission, or NTF). The model was successfully used to analyze two cases of quantitative changes of isotope ratios in Ti and Pd cathodes and the surface topography change. . . .",

The experimental results are divided into three sets: excess heat measurements; yield of impurity nuclides (nuclear ash); X-ray measurements. Up to 8Wof excess power was observed, with a power gain of up to 170% was seen in glow discharge experiments. Up to 300 W of excess power, with a power gain up to 340% was observed in experiments using a high voltage electrolysis cell. The impurity nuclide yield showing a shift of up to a few per cent from natural isotopic abundances was detected by spark mass spectrometry, by secondary ionic mass spectrometry, and by secondary neutral mass spectrometry. X-ray emission in the range of 0.6-6.0 keV, and up to 0.1 W/cm2 has been observed. Based on these experimental results we propose a phenomenological model for LENR based on the interaction of an electric discharge with condensed matter (of the cathode).",

In contrast, this essay argues that demarcation is most usefully viewed as a practical matter, rhetorically negotiated by scientists (and other social actors) in particular interest-driven rhetorical contexts. A case study of the 1989 cold fusion controversy illustrates an implicit demarcation rhetoric which grew out of the professional physics community's interest-driven need to provide a plausible explanation for the errors committed by the Utah cold fusion team. Close analysis of the discourses in the controversy reveals the active construction of working definitions of science and suggests that those definitions ultimately circumscribed the evidential grounds on which the ontological status of cold fusion was ajudicated by the scientific community.",

    "abstract": "As reported in previous papers, anomalous heat generation occurs when nickel or palladium powder is exposed to hydrogen or deuterium gas, while there is also a chemical effect that occurs when hydrogen (or deuterium) gas is absorbed by mixed oxides of Pd and Zr. Many experiments were previously conducted while increasing either initial temperature or pressure in the reaction chamber. In this report, we conducted fundamental experiments of hydrogen gas absorption by metal powder, while increasing both temperature and pressure simultaneously. The experiments were conducted in conditions up to 244?C and 0.5 MPa, using a small constant-volume reaction system developed by us. As a result, about 4 K of temperature rise was observed in the experiment using nickel powder, and about 10 K was observed in the experiment using Pd-Ni-Zr composite powder. In these experimental results, there are positive correlations between the temperature rise and both the initial temperature and loaded gas pressure. This result may show that the temperature rise is assisted by not only preheating but also gas absorption under higher pressure.",

The reactor, named E-Cat, is charged with a small amount of hydrogen-loaded nickel powder plus some additives, mainly Lithium. The reaction is primarily initiated by heat from resistor coils around the reactor tube. Measurements of the radiated power from the reactor were performed with high-resolution thermal imaging cameras. The measurements of electrical power input were performed with a large bandwidth three-phase power analyzer. Data were collected during 32 days of running in March 2014. The reactor operating point was set to about 1260?C in the first half of the run, and at about 1400 ?C in the second half. The measured energy balance between input and output heat yielded a COP factor of about 3.2 and 3.6 for the 1260?C and 1400?C runs, respectively. The total net energy obtained during the 32 days run was about 1.5 MWh. This amount of energy is far more than can be obtained from any known chemical sources in the small reactor volume. A sample of the fuel was carefully examined with respect to its isotopic composition before the run and after the run, using several standard methods: XPS, EDS, SIMS, ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The isotope composition in Lithium and Nickel was found to agree with the natural composition before the run, while after the run it was found to have changed substantially. Nuclear reactions are therefore indicated to be present in the run process, which however is hard to reconcile with the fact that no radioactivity was detected outside the reactor during the run.",

As a result, energy far exceeding input was continuously obtained. In the best results obtained thus far, the output thermal energy is double the input electrical energy, amounting to several hundred watts. The generated thermal energy follows an exponential temperature function. When the reactor temperature is 300?C, the generated energy is 1 kW.

In every case a notable amount of Fe atoms were detected together with a certain amount of excess energy evolution, being in the range of 9 x 10^15 to 1.8 x 10^16 atoms/cm^2 for Au and of 1.2 x 10^15 to 4.0 x 10^16 atoms/cm^2 for Pd. The isotopic abundance of these Fe atoms was measured by means of SIMS, which was 6.5, 77.5, and 14.5% for 54Fe, 56Fe and 57Fe, respectively, at the top surface of Au electrode, obviously different from the natural values. For Pd electrode, a considerable increase in the contents of 54Fe and 57Fe was observed.",

In the case of gas and plasma loaded \"dry\" samples, surface tritium content was measured directly using windowless beta counters.

The transient cavitation bubble, TCB, has been harnessed to produce high densities of deuterons, 10^25 to 25/cc.  An electrically driven piezo device filled with D2O produces acoustic field generating TCBs that are, in the final collapse stage, micro accelerators.  The result is the implanting of deuterons into a target foil producing 4He originating from the Pd foil and T from the Ti foil.  We are an emergent tangent technology to sonoluminescence, SL, technology, which we use to give us an environmental parameter probe into the bubble contents at the moment of its highest energy density.  (Much of the SL studies center on the pulses of photons coupled to the irradiating acoustic field emanating from an oscillating single stable cavitation bubble, SSCB.) The generation of these photons relates to conditions for the target implantation process.  Recently we have been studying the effects of frequency on multi TCB SL conditions that produce fusion.  These experiments and the analytical methods have concentrated on the mass spectroscopy of reactor gases, calorimetry of the reactor and power supply, and the scanning electron microscope photographs of target foils.  The results from many experiments are pieced together to reach a plausible path for the TCB that terminates with deuterons implanting into a target with the resulting fusion events.  The use of SL for monitoring the bubble content?s high energy densities allows for reactor parameter management for fusion events in the target foil.  Studies of multi TCBs' SL at higher temperatures (300-450?K), external pressures (10^6-10^7.5 dynes/cm2) and frequencies (.02- 1.7 MHz) are proceeding in a search for better fusion environments.

This question is normally asked in the context of the statement that Quantum Mechanics shows that this phenomenon is impossible (a view that we share). Our answer is always based on the statement 'but what about the modelling of such systems in terms of QED?' which is always met by the insistence that Quantum Mechanics shows that Cold Fusion is impossible. We conclude that scientists do not understand QED or, if they have some understanding of this subject, then this must be subject to some major misconceptions. This pointless dialogue (perhaps more correctly described as two monologues conducted in parallel) and the insistence on the primacy of Quantum Mechanics in the modelling of systems in the Natural Sciences is unfortunate because it obscures the outcome of the investigations in the more normal fields of the Natural Sciences (more normal than Cold Fusion). A brief outline of the work which has led to the formulation of the concept of coherence will therefore be given under the aegis of the revolutions in our understanding of the Natural Sciences which has taken place since the latter part of the 19. Century. The main illustration of the way we can demonstrate the applicability of these concepts will be based on the study of nucleation and phase growth. The development of micro-electrode substrates allows us to study the statistics of the formation of the first nucleus; it will be shown that these statistics are strictly in line with concepts developed from QED coherence. We conclude that QED coherence is not just a concept to be confined to sub-atomic physics, cosmology etc. but that it pervades the modelling of the whole of the Natural Sciences including that of 'Cold Fusion'. Some of the major steps which have taken place in the development of this subject area will be illustrated",

How can H(0) form in PC near the cathode interface? Nanometric cavities (NC) were observed in the PC near their cathode interfaces. These NC would contain H2 precipitates with impurities, under a pressure of the order of 0.1 GPa. Since PC are crossed by a large flux of protons, a simple mechanism is proposed to increase the H2 pressure in these NC rapidly and temporarily well above the PC tensile strength. A second mechanism is then described to turn this H2 into a metallic-molecular state, form a Rydberg matter H(1) and then H(0) with a pressure decrease. In NC, the presence of impurities and the entry of the hydrogen atoms in the form of Rydberg atoms are proposed to decrease the pressure required to form metallic-molecular hydrogen.

To solve molecular dynamics motion of 4D/TSC condensation, a nonlinear Langevin equation was formulated with a Coulombic main condensation force term under Platonic symmetry, 6 balancing forces of dde*(2,2) EQPET molecules on 6 faces of TSC cube, and a random quantum mechanical fluctuation term f(t) for deuteron-to-deuteron distance Rdd. The form of ensemble average <f(t)> becomes C/Rdd2 type deceleration force as positive bias to main condensation force, to be about 15% bias. Molecular dynamics calculation with TSC Langevin equation by the Verlet time-step method was then done. Barrier factors for fusion reactions as a function of Rdd(t) and 4D fusion rate per TSC generation were calculated using modeled potentials and Fermi's golden rule. We found that 4D/TSC got to the TSC-minimum state with 10 fm-20 fm radius in 1.4007 fs and 4D fusion rate was about 100% per 4D/TSC generation-condensation. Thus we concluded that 4He production rate by 4D/TSC was equal to two times the 4D/TSC generation rate in condensed matter (e.g., PdDx).",

Excess heat from a high current glow discharge reaction in D2 , Xe and Kr using cathodes already charged with preliminary deuterium-charged Pd and Ti cathode samples are given. Excess heat up to 10 - 15 W and efficiency up to 130% was recorded under the experiments for Pd cathode samples in D2  discharge. Excess heat up to 5 W and efficiency up to 150% was recorded for Pd cathodes that were charged with deuterium before the run, in Xe and Kr discharges.

Of special note is that the peak of the theoretical curve of tritium production versus loading fraction, which is related to that for neutrons by a branching ratio scaling factor, is found to be at a fractional DlPd loading of approximately 0.825, whlch is in go.od agreement with the empirical value of 0.83 announced at the ICCF-5 by Iwamura et al.(Mitsuoishi) for both tritlUm and neutrons. It is of interest then that this theoretical ECFM tritium production curve arises essentially from purely statistical mechanical considerations involving the deuteron occupation of the three-dimensional interstitial lattice, rather than arising from the details of a specific nuclear mechanism. The model shows why tritium is ordinarily not observed when excess heat is being observed. For the neutron-to-triton branching ratio a theoretical lower limit (r/R)^12 results (r is the protonic charge radius and R is the deuteronic charge radius.) yielding a value of 2 x 10^-9 in agreement with the empirical value of 2 x 10^-9 for the neutron-to-triton branching ratio.",

The result of high density pinched implantation of D+ and e-, deuterons and electrons; plasma is a D+ cluster. The implant occurs in a picosecond time frame with a creation of D+/Pd, in a 100/1 ratio of an initially electron free D+ cluster with a diameter in the order of a hundred nm. The mobile e- react with D+ and surround the D+ cluster with D. DD fusion events occurring in the transient high-density cluster produce a gamma free heat pulse. The heat pulse reaches the lattice surface in a nanosecond expelling the vapor/liquid foil and products as ejecta. The ejecta sites are easily seen in SEM photos and are counted and plotted as MeV DD fusion events. The results have been interpreted as DD fusion events that increase in energy as they decrease in frequency (counts) exponentially.",

    "abstract": "The production of excess energy in palladium cathodes electrochemically loaded with deuterium (the Fleischmann?Pons Experiment) has been debated in the literature since its first publication in 1989. In a subset of 61 trials, we electrochemically loaded palladium?rhodium foil cathodes with deuterium from alkaline solutions of heavy water in specially designed closed calorimeter cells. We observed excess energy bursts in the range 2.4?44.3 kJ in 6% of these experiments. Additionally, a conservative estimate of the total integrated output energy is greater than the total integrated input energy in these experiments. This paper documents the steps taken to examine these results thoroughly for calibration/measurement errors and instrumental artifacts. A 2.4 kJ energy burst is at least four times greater than the energy released by oxidizing deuterium in the cell headspace. The data and subsequent elimination of alternative explanations for excess energy production lead us to conclude that the excess energy is real and of yet unknown origin.",

From earlier studies, screening is thought to be similar to the case of molecular D2 . Resonant tunneling has been advocated in the literature as a possible mechanism to achieve tunneling enhancements. We develop a two-level system for a piecewise constant potential model for resonant tunneling that matches the energy levels in the vicinity of a level crossing, arguing that such models are applicable for more general potential models. Resonant tunneling effects and dynamics, including acceleration due to coherence, are accounted for in the model. The model is extended to include relaxation effects, and it is found that one would not expect to find coherent effects associated with tunneling in the case of two deuterons in a metal lattice. We present a simple model for the transfer of excitation from a collection of deuterons to a collection of helium nuclei, a model closely related to resonant tunneling and also to new phonon-coupled SU(N) models under development. The excitation transfer models show coherent enhancements as well as collective effects.",

Formation of quadruplet e*(4,4) electronic quasi-particle and octal-coupling e*(8,8) around lattice focal points with D-clusters which realize super screening for d-d and d-cluster Coulomb barrier is modeled for tetrahedral and octahedral symmetric condensations and discussed. Based on the electronic quasi-particle expansion theory (EQPET), modal fusion rates which are composed of 2D, 3D, 4D and 8D fusion rates with characteristic values for each mode are estimated for the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetric condensations. Based on given modal fusion rates we can estimate macroscopic cluster fusion rates (f/s/cc) by knowing time-averaged values of D-cluster densities. Several to few hundreds w/cc level fusion rates for 4D and 8D can be foreseen with major ash of 4He and a variety of secondary transmutation reactions, and neutron production rate by 2D fusion will be with 10-12 orders smaller magnitude than that of 4He production.

The x-rays were recorded using thermoluminescent detectors, x-ray film, and scintillation detectors with photomultipliers. Two different modes of the emission were observed during these experiments:(1) Diffusion x-rays were observed as separate x-ray bursts (up to 10^5 bursts a second and up to 10^6 x-ray quanta in a burst) with an average x-rays energy (from measurements using thermoluminescent detectors) in the range of 1.3-1.8keV.(2) X-rays as laser microbeams (up to 10^4 beams a second and up to 10^9 x-ray quanta in a burst).

This model is the single most successful theoretical model that the ?eld has seen since it started; it has served as the theoretical justi?cation for a program at NASA; and it has accumulated an enormous number of supporters both within and outside of the condensed matter nuclear science community. The ?rst step in the model involves the proposed accumulation of mass by electrons through Coulomb interactions with electrons and ions in highly-excited coupled plasmon and optical phonon modes. Historically for us this mass increase has been hard to understand, so we were motivated in this study to understand better how this comes about. To study it, we consider simple classical models which show the effect, from which we see that the mass increase can be associated with the electron kinetic energy. The basic results of the simple classical model carry over to the quantum problem in the case of simple wave packet solutions. Since there are no quantum ?uctuations of the longitudinal ?eld in the Coulomb gauge, the resulting problem is conventional, and we ?nd no reason to expect MeV electron kinetic energy in a conventional consideration of electrons in metals. We consider the numerical example outlined in a primer on the Widom?Larsen model, and ?nd that multiple GW/cm2 would be required to support the level of vibrational excitation assumed in the surface layer; this very large power per unit area falls short by orders of magnitude the power level needed to make up the expected energy loss of the mass-enhanced electrons. We note that the mass enhancement of an electron in a transverse ?eld is connected to acceleration, so that the electron radiates. A similar effect is expected in the longitudinal case, and a very large amount of easily detected X-ray radiation would be expected if an MeV-level mass enhancement were present even in a modest number of electrons",

Two nano-sized metal multilayer composite samples, which were composed of Ni, Cu, CaO, Y2O3 thin films on bulk Ni (25 mm ? 25 mm ? 0.1 mm), were placed in a vacuum chamber. These samples were fabricated by Ar ion beam sputtering method. After baking of the samples, H2 gas was introduced into the chamber up to about 230 Pa at 250 deg C. Then, the Ni based multilayer thin films started to absorb H2 gas. Amount of absorbed H2 gas can be evaluated by the pressure measurement of the chamber. Typically, after about 50,000 s, H2 gas was evacuated and simultaneously the samples were heated up by the ceramic heater up to 500?900 deg C. The evacuation and heating process seem to trigger heat generation reactions. Heat burst phenomena were simultaneously detected by a radiation thermometer looking at the surface of the multilayer thin film and a thermocouple located near the metal composite. It shows that heat measurement by the thermocouple embedded in the ceramic heater correctly reflects surface temperature detected by the radiation thermometer. Excess energy generation using nano-sized multilayer Cu/Ni metal composite and Cu/Ni metal with third material (CaO, Y2O3) composite were presented. Maximum released excess energy reached 1.1 MJ and average released energy per absorbed total hydrogen was 16 keV/H or 1.5 GJ/H-mol. It cannot be explained by any known chemical process and suggests that the observed heat generation must be of nuclear origin. Various analysis methods, such as SEM-EDX or TOF-SIMS, had been applied to obtain information about what kind of reactions occur by the interaction of the nano-sized multilayer metal composite with hydrogen gas.",

The EPRI program began in April, 1 989, and has continued to the present time attempting to replicate the claimed excess heat and determine its source. Under conditions difficult to achieve, some 16 separate experiments have successfully reached that goal out of some 35 major attempts. The conditions found necessary for an observation of excess heat were found to be at least three in number: 1) atomic loading ratio (DlPd) > -0.9; 2) Initiation time of 8 to 23 days; 3) current density >0. 1 amperes per cm^2 of cathode area. A fourth condition suggested by the results of a recent experiment is that the FLUX of deuterium across the palladium metal surface must be above some threshold value. No definitive source for the excess heat has been yet robustly determined, but measurable helium-4 has been observed in the cell vapor space in a few cases. The major evidence that the heat may be from nuclear reactions is its magnitude - some 10 to 100 times larger than any known chemical reaction. The objective of the continuing effort is focussed upon identifying the source of the excess heat. Sonic cavitation at a Pd-D2O interface has apparently produced both He-4 in the vapor phase as well as apparent excess heat. This research has identified a huge matrix of possible experiments to confirm or refute various hypotheses on the source of the heat. To acquire sufficient resources to explore this matrix requires, in my opinion, a definitive signature of a nuclear reaction connected with the production of heat.

In order for the X-rays to be collimated, there must either be an X-ray laser present, or else a phased-array collimation effect produced by emitting dipoles that radiate in phase. Although there have been arguments made in support of an X-ray laser origin of the effect, from our perspective this approach suffers from an absence of a plausible mechanism, short excited-state electronic lifetimes, high power requirements, and an incompatibility between the experimental geometry and the need for an elongated laser medium for beam formation. In this work we consider a model for beam formation due to many emitting dipoles randomly positioned within a circle on a mathematically flat surface. When the emitting dipole density is low, a speckle pattern is produced. Above a critical emitting dipole density beam formation occurs. The average intensity of the speckle and beam is estimated from simple statistical models at low and high dipole density, and combined to develop an empirical intensity estimate over the full range of dipole densities which compares well with numerical simulations. Beam formation occurs above a critical number of emitting dipoles, which allows us to develop an estimate for the minimum number of emitting dipoles present in the Karabut experiment.

Minor displacements quadratic in the surface coordinates can produce focusing and defocusing effects, leading to a natural explanation for intense spot and line formation observed in the experiments.",

Our isoperibolic (IPB) cell/calorimeter is operated as an isothermal compensation type calorimeter. Potential sources of error in this system are discussed as well the methods used to minimize them. In power compensation mode the cell is held at a constant temperature using a heater power feedback system and constant power pulses or DC power steps are added to the system, resulting in a reduction of heater power. The relationship between this heater power reduction and DC power passed along the reactor core yields a calibration curve at different temperatures that allows us to evaluate how much output power increased during a given stimulation pulse. The IPB cell/calorimeter was stimulated by commanding different pulse widths at constant amplitude with the pulse power held constant by appropriately varying the pulse repetition rate. At 250?300?C the ratio of output power increase to input pulse power varied from 1.0 to over 2.0 depending on the pulse width at constant input power. That ratio was always 1.0 at all pulse widths attempted at 600?C. These results have been seen tens of times. The amount of excess power was also dependent on the composition of the gas and the metal alloy coatings on the core. The outer layer of the core was always pure Ni. The composition of a multilayer metal?dielectric metal coated core was chosen to allow for reasonable hydrogen solubility and mobility at 300?C. The results of various experiments are discussed Importantly these results presented here ignore the heater power necessary to maintain temperature and the losses in the pulse generator, which can be several times greater than either the stimulation power or power gain.",

Recent neutron diffraction results for deuterium solution in this crystalline phase have indicated that deuterium occupies only one type of interstice, i.e., a Pd-defined pyramidal site in a four-fold position situated on a quadrilateral face of an empty triangular prism. The vibrational dynamics of both H and D located at this site were investigated by neutron vibrational spectroscopy. The low-temperature density of states (DOS) of H in Pd9Si2H0.25 indicates three well-defined optic vibrations located at 49.4, 67.2 and 75.5 meV. The lowest-energy feature is assigned to the normal-mode vibration perpendicular to the pyramidal base and the two higher-energy features are assigned to the two orthogonal normal-mode vibrations parallel to this base. The low-temperature DOS of D in Pd9Si2D0.25 indicates corresponding normal-mode energies at 31.4, 50.8 and 57.2 meV. This yields H/D energy ratios of 1.57 for the low-energy and 1.32 for both higher-energy modes, reflecting an unusual potential for this pyramidal site. The room temperature DOS of H in Pd9Si2H0.25 displays a substantial smearing of the vibrational features, suggesting the presence of significant H diffusional motion at this temperature.

Four experimental approaches are being pursued: electrolysis, glow-discharge, gas loading in catalyst cells and high-pressure high-temperature cell with ultrasonic wave excitation. The experimental setups developed by ET are described along with preliminary results obtained. A significant amount of excess heat was measured in the first glow discharge experiment. The power generated during the experiment was up to 3.9 times the input power. When driven with waves the excess heat was higher than when driven with DC. A significant amount of excess heat was also measured after the shutdown of the glow discharge; it lasted for approximately 10 hours. The total excess energy generated is estimated to be 6.7 times the input energy. The \"heat-after-death\" phenomenon was also observed in another glow discharge experiment. Excess heat up to approximately 80% was measured over a period of over 3 months in yet another glow discharge experiment. Driving the electrolytic cells with waves resulted in a faster loading than when driving them with DC of the same average current. The tritium concentration in the electrolyte measured at the end of the experiments was found to be up to more than 100% the pre-experiment level. No excess heat was measured, so far, in the catalyst cells. Successful loading of Pd target with D was obtained in the high-pressure high-temperature gas cell without going through the alpha+beta phase of the Pd-D system.",

It reports on the experimental study of LENR phenomena in Constantan (Cu55Ni44Mn1) from its inception in 2011 to the most recent experiments. Using an empirical approach we identified the effect of surface modification of the Constantan wires with coatings comprised of elements that enhance the absorption behavior, and oxides with low work function for electron emission. We also explored certain geometrical arrangements of the wires such as knots and coils in order to induce local thermal gradients and predictable hot-spots. Moreover, the DC polarization of the wires by a counter-electrode proved to be a versatile approach to induce non-equilibrium conditions that are essential for Anomalous Heat Effects (AHE), especially when a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is produced. From the review of experiments summarized in this article, we obtain indications that the main parameter controlling the AHE is the flux of reactive species through the surface of the loaded material. As a consequence, all other external conditions of the reactor core (voltage?current, temperature, pressure, electric field stimulations, DC and/or AC external fields), can be seen as co-factors that enable a flux of active species through surfaces and in the bulk of the materials. Although most of the tests are in agreement with a possible flux model, some results still lack an interpretation, probably due to limits of the experimental setup.",

Models that describe this also suggest that low energy vibrational quanta can be up-converted to produce nuclear excitation. Karabut?s collimated X-ray emission has been interpreted as being due to the up-conversion of vibrational energy in a small cathode to produce excitation in 201Hg. To test this, we developed a new experiment to vibrate a copper foil with and without surface Hg, and we looked for X-ray emission and charge emission from the surface. Signals were observed in the detectors in both cases; however, the signals in the X-ray detector did not respect the absorption edge of the Be window and are artifacts; and the large current signals associated with charge emission did not charge a capacitor in a simple configuration. We conclude that both are artifacts. The absence of collimated X-ray emission in this case is interpreted as due to the absence of strong low energy nuclear transitions in the copper, and also as ruling out a candidate theoretical model involving up-conversion due to interactions with negative energy transitions. A new interpretation of the Karabut experiment focuses now on lower frequency vibrations in the massive steel cathode holder and vacuum chamber as responsible for the up-conversion, and transfer of the up-converted energy to surface 201Hg to produce the collimated X-ray emission.",

We employed a He-3 neutron detector and a NE-2 1 3 scintillator to measure neutron emission and energy distribution. We counted up to several million neutrons per second. High heat output of the order of several hundred watts was observed from input power of tens of wattsThe neutron counts detected by the He-3 detector increased with discharge time after an induction period, and showed radical fluctuations. Absorption of neutrons by cadmium showed them to be thermal Copper and iron showed no count changes. The rate of neutron emission increased with the input volt Moreover, the rate was increased with the concentration of the ions and their mass number. Their rate was ten times higher in heavy water than light water solution. The neutron emission rate corresponded linearly with the input current, except at the low input coulomb range due to induction time. From this linear relation, it was observed that the typical dependence of neutron emission/current during 1 hour was 1000000 /s/A/cm2 for a platinum electrode in 0.5 molar potassium carbonate of heavy water solution.We can conclude that a nuclear reaction would be induced by the electric discharge on the metal surface in the solution.

The generation of hydrogen far in excess of amounts predicted by Faraday?s law is continuously observed when conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Non-Faraday generation of hydrogen gas sometimes produces more than 80 times as much hydrogen as normal electrolysis does. Unfortunately there have been few claimed replications of excess hydrogen, even in rare cases in which excess heat is claimed. In most cases, no excess heat or hydrogen is observed.

Using those lattice structures, the favorable modes of fission have been simulated and the fission fragments compared with the transmutation products, as reported by Mizuno [2]. It is shown that (i) the changes in relative abundance of the Pd isotopes, and (ii) the main transmutation products in Mizuno-style LENR studies are consistent with the idea that the bulk of the energy released in such experiments is due to the fission of Palladium isotopes.",

Transmutation products were successfully increased by this approach.

Roughly 1-2?103 particle emissions, including both hydrogen and helium isotopes, in whole space were observed in each case. Collisions between recoilled D atoms due to the high energy electron impact give only 10-12 to 10-26 times smaller fusion rates than the experimental results. The present observations suggest the presence of a new kind of fusion reaction which occurs with negligible kinetic energy of the reacting nuclei.",

The theory describes correctly the observed target material dependence of the screening energies, underestimating, however, the absolute values by about a factor of 2. Applying an effective screening energy approach, the theoretical cross-sections, thick-target yields as well as nuclear reaction rates have been calculated down to the energies corresponding to the conditions of so-called cold-fusion experiments. This allows for a comparison of the experimental results at higher energies with those achieved in the heavy-water electrolysis experiments.",

    "abstract": "Based on the optical theorem formulation of low-energy nuclear reactions, we show that a Gamow factor cancellation can occur for nuclear fusion reactions if the imaginary part of the effective nuclear interaction in the elastic channel has a small component of a finite longrange interaction. It is recently shown that a near cancellation of the Gamow factor at low energies can occur if one of the final-state nuclei has a weakly bound (\"halo\") excited state. Another mechanism for the Gamow factor cancellation is a continuum-electron shielding of nuclear charge by a dense electron plasma. If the Gamow factor cancellation occurs, it can lead to a large enhancement of reaction rates and probabilities for low-energy nuclear fusion reaction and nuclear fission, and may provide nuclear physics mechanisms for explaining the anomalous effects observed in low-energy nuclear reactions. Several specific cases of the anomalous effects are discussed in terms of nuclear physics mechanisms, including cluster-impact nuclear reactions which may be relevant to the low-energy nuclear transmutation.",

The paper by Legget and Baym appears of fundamental relevance to this respect. In that work a rigorous upper bound is given for the fusion rate of deuterons embedded in a crystal, which is too small to be compatible with the claimed experimental values. The upper bound is expressed mainly in terms of the chemical potential of neutral helium atoms and deuteron molecules with respect to a crystal of Palladium, or in general of the absorbing material. The smallness of this upper bound is a consequence of the small value of the chemical potential of neutral helium atoms. The latter has been taken to be close to zero, according to the experimental evidence. . . .",

Our analysis of these data indicates that, contrary to their conclusions, a statistically significant increase of nuclear emissions was actually detected by them during cavitation experiments with chilled deuterated acetone. In particular, the emission rate they measured was ~3 n/s (compared to about 8 n/s in our measurements). Shapira and Saltmarsh grossly over-estimated the efficiency of their detector. Actually, their detection efficiency for 2.5 MeV neutrons (based on calibration with a Pu-Be source and corrected for distance and shielding), was found to be ~10-5. Using this value of efficiency their detected nuclear emission rate was ~ 2 x 105 n/s, a value which is comparable to that reported by us, and consistent with the results from our tritium measurements. Statistically significant time-correlated neutron emissions during sonoluminescence (SL) bursts was also observed, however their system was poorly designed for coincidence measurements; particularly, for the most energetic bubble implosions subsequent to cavitation",

A closed cell electrolytic experiment has been conducted using a palladium cathode and platinum anode with accurate (+/-0.001 watt) calorimetric measurements. Results indicate a positive energy output of approximately 50 Kilojoules more than was input to the experiment through electrolysis current and heater current. The heat output was observed both as short term bursts of energy and as long term sustained production. Colorimetric calibration with an internal heat source showed essentially identical data before and after the electrolysis experiment. Material balance for palladium, water and lithium showed essentially no material had been consumed during the experiment. Tritium levels measured before and after electrolysis showed a factor of 3 increase that cannot be accounted for by concentration effects.",

The exact nature of these events and the conditions leading to their initiation are poorly understood. In fact, the existence of such events is questioned by many [2]. The present position among those investigating this problem [3] is as follows: enthalpy production is a non-steady state process whose rate depends on the nature of the electrode material; however, the observed steady state production arises from an averaging of small perturbations. Nuclear events are believed to occur on the electrode surface as well as within the electrode interior.",

It is worth seeing, however, how nonscientists perceived the scientific issues and supporting evidence surrounding cold fusion. From Clifford Geertz's anthropology of meanings-and-symbols, plus Jean Baudrillard's sociology of hyperreality, I derive a general theory that common public symbols of science can be separated from the intellectual substance of science, and then attributed to beliefs and ideologies that do not necessarily have anything to do with science. The result is to make nonscientific matters seem scientific. In the case of cold fusion, a naive hope about abundant cheap energy displaced the science behind the cold fusion hypothesis. That hope was then sustained by a certain visual image of the cold fusion hypothesis; by selective science journalism; and, by a simplistic sociology of science, thereby making it seem that naive hope was substantiated by science.",
